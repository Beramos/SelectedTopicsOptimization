# Quadratic optimization

---

Quadratic systems are important:
  - Systems close to their maximum can closely be approximated by a quadratic
    system, studying the minimization of quadratic systems can teach us about
    minimization of general convex functions.
  - Quadratic systems are important in their own right! Many statistical models,
    graph problems, molecular models etc. can be formulated as quadratic
    systems!

## Warming up: one-dimensional quadratic systems

In the the scalar case, a quadratic function is given by

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}px^2+qx +r\,, $$

with $p>0$ (we will shortly see why).

Our optimization problem is given by:

$$ \min_x\,\frac{1}{2}px^2+qx +r\,. $$
