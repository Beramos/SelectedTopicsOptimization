abstract = {Experiments in ecology can have unintended side effects. Recently, it has been suggested that the act of visiting a plant, inherent to,studying herbivory, may alter plant performance and interactions. To evaluate the generality of this inference, we examined plant performance and herbivory on 14 plant species in three geographic regions. Visitation did not, significantly affect any of the variables that we measured, including leaf damage, height, biomass, or survivorship, for any species. However, rates of herbivory varied significantly among sites, and regions. Thus, our data do not support the generality of visitation impacting estimates of herbivory. We propose that future studies of. herbivory will gain more by evaluating spatial heterogeneity in interaction outcomes than by quantifying possible experimenter-caused variation.},

abstract = {Herbivory first evolved in terrestrial mammals during the late Cretaceous, similar to 100 million years ago (Mya). Of the similar to 35 ordinal-level clades of extinct or extant eutherian mammals from the New World, similar to 24 have been adapted to herbivory in one form or another. Dental adaptations for specialized terrestrial browsing are first recognized during the early Cenozoic (Paleocene-Eocene). Mammalian herbivores adapted for grazing did not become widespread in the New World until the middle Cenozoic; it seems that this adaptation and the spread of grasslands occurred during the late Oligocene (30 Mya) in South America similar to 10 million years earlier than in North America (20 Mya). Carbon isotopic evidence from fossil herbivore teeth indicates that C3 plants predominated until the late Miocene (similar to8 Mya). Thereafter, C3 and C4 terrestrial communities diversified. Late Pleistocene extinctions similar to 10,000 years ago decimated the diversity of mammalian herbivores, particularly those of larger body size.},

abstract = {Traits that are attractive to mutualists may also attract antagonists, resulting in conflicting selection pressures. Here we develop the idea that increased floral nectar production can, in some cases, increase herbivory. In these situations, selection for increased nectar production to attract pollinators may be constrained by a linked cost of herbivore attraction. In support of this hypothesis, we report that experimentally supplementing nectar rewards in Datura stramonium led to increased oviposition by Manduca sexta, a sphingid moth that pollinates flowers, but whose larvae feed on leaf tissue. We speculate that nectar composition may provide information about plant nutritional status or defense that floral visitors could use to make oviposition decisions. Thus, selection by floral visitors and leaf herbivores may be inextricably intertwined, and herbivores may represent a relatively unexplored agent of selection on nectar traits.},

abstract = {Current knowledge of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region is summarized. Some degree of frugivory has been reported for many fish and reptile species, almost half the genera of non-marine mammals and more than 40{\%} of bird genera in the region. Highly frugivorous species, for which fruit dominates the diet for at least part of the year, occur in at least two families of reptiles, 12 families of mammals and 17 families of birds. Predation on seeds in fleshy fruits is much less widespread taxonomically: the major seed predators are colobine monkeys and rodents among the mammals, and parrots, some pigeons, and finches among the birds. Most seeds in the Oriental Region, except near its northern margins, are dispersed by vertebrate families which are endemic to the region or to the Old World. Small fruits and large, soft fruits with many small seeds are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species which thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger, bigger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation and habitat loss.},

abstract = {An economy of scale may lead to selection to increase interannual variation in seed production when the per seed probability of seedling establishment. increases with seed production. Variable annual seedfall will, however, reduce this probability when post-dispersal seed fate is negatively density dependent on the local density of seeds, and seed dispersal and density dependence act identically across years. Intuitively, more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density-dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production.We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment, evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed-to-seedling transition, and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seedfall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5-m(2) seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1-m(2) seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species. The density of seedling recruits tended to increase with the density of seeds; however, the per seed probability of recruitment invariably decreased with seedfall density. Negative density dependence characterized the seed-to-seedling transition. Observed levels of spatial and interannual variation in seedfall density would reduce long-term recruitment by up to 28{\%} if negatively density-dependent survival acted identically across years; however, the strength of negative density dependence varied significantly among years for 12 of 32 species. Negative density dependence occurred in all years for these species but was significantly weaker during the one or two years of greatest seedfall than during the remaining years of lower seedfall. The per seed probability of recruitment increased significantly with annual seedfall for eight of these species. These eight species realized postdispersal economies of scale despite the reduction in long-term recruitment expected from the synergism between variable annual seed production and negatively density-dependent seed fate.},

abstract = {Several tropical forest legume species producing hard and brightly-colored seeds, which apparently evolved as mimics of fleshy fruit and arillate-seed models, have been presumed to be dispersed by avian frugivores through non-mutualistic interactions involving sensorial deception. Here we examine the interactions between a typical so-called ''mimetic seed'' species and its potential dispersers in an Amazonian forest site, and propose that such interactions are best interpreted as mutualistic. Ormosia lignivalvis (Leguminosae: Papilionaceae) is a relatively rare but widespread canopy tree producing naked seeds with a conspicuous, bicolored (scarlet and black) hard seed coat, containing no nutrient rewards to its putative dispersers. Mature seeds are gradually released from dehiscent pods in a piecemeal fashion, during an extended fruiting period of up to 8 months, but may be retained by persistent funicles throughout the year. Intact Ormosia seeds were found in stomach contents of large-bodied terrestrial birds - including one tinamou, one trumpeter, and two cracid species - which appear to be the main dispersers. On the other hand, a total of 185 h of vigils of 5 fruiting tree crowns failed to result in any observed cases of seed removal by arboreal frugivores. Laboratory measurements of seed resistance, elasticity, and hardness showed that Ormosia seeds are extremely hard, and could, therefore, aid in the mechanical breakdown of softer seeds which make up a large proportion of the diet of these terrestrial granivores. We argue that the hard, non-elastic O. lignivalvis seeds, and perhaps a number of other so-called mimetic-seed species, can function as similarly shaped and sized mineral grit universally swallowed by large gallinaceous birds, in that they help to crush and grind the mostly pliable seeds digested by their dispersers. This interaction is thus best described as a mutualism in that (1) Ormosia germination is greatly enhanced by the abrasive gut treatment of avian granivores, and (2) such birds would otherwise find no adequate gizzard grit substitutes in environments conspicuously lacking small pebbles, such as the lowland rainforests of sedimentary river basins of Amazonia.},

abstract = {Inducible plant resistance against herbivores is becoming a paradigm of plant-herbivore ecology. Fundamental to understanding induced resistance and its evolutionary ecology is specificity of 'induction' and 'effects'. Specificity in the induction of resistance refers to whether plant damage by various herbivores causes the same response in plants. Specificity in the effects of induced resistance refers to whether induction has the same consequences (i.e., reduced preference or performance) for various herbivores. I examined both specificity of induction and effect employing four lepidopteran herbivores and wild radish plants, a system for which fitness benefits and costs of induction have been documented for the plant. Variation in the specificity of induction and effects of induced plant resistance was found; however, this variation was not associated with diet specialization in the herbivores (i.e., specialists vs generalists). Induction caused by Plutella (specialist) and Spodoptera (generalist) resulted in general resistance to all of the herbivores, induction caused by Pieris (specialist) induced resistance only to Spodoptera (generalist) and Pieris, and plant damage by Trichoplusia (generalist) failed to induce resistance and reduce the performance of any of the herbivores. To the contrary, plants damaged by Trichoplusia supported enhanced growth of subsequently feeding Trichoplusia compared to uninduced controls. These results add a novel level of complexity to interactions between plants and leaf chewing caterpillars. Within the same guild of feeders, some herbivores cause strong induced resistance, no induced resistance, or induced susceptibility. Similarly, caterpillar species were variable in the level to which induced resistance affected their performance. Such interactions limit the possibility of pairwise coevolution between plants and herbivores, and suggest that coevolution can only be diffuse.},

abstract = {The southern Iberian Peninsula is one of the most important refugia of Tertiary relict plant taxa in Europe. Under the present summer-dry climate, relict populations may experience a severely reduced regeneration. We studied the demographic structure, seed set and initial recruitment in relict populations of the endangered tree Frangula alnus subsp. baetica (Rhamnaceae) to evaluate its regeneration potential under the present environmental conditions. Populations are restricted to small riparian forests of Southwest Spanish and North Moroccan mountain ranges. The distribution of fruit crop sizes was highly left-skewed, and a few old trees produced the large bulk of the population seed pool. Bird-mediated seed dispersal appeared inefficient and post-dispersal seed predation by mice was high. Secondary seed transport by elevated creek water flow after winter rains modified the primary seed dispersal, but in consequence most seeds germinated on recently formed sandbanks where seedlings experienced reduced initial growth and survival. The most important mortality factor was desiccation, followed by herbivory. None of 1144 monitored seedlings survived for 2 years. The demographic survey through five populations indicates that drought periods may cause temporal regeneration bottlenecks. Moreover, over the last two decades populations have experienced increasing regeneration problems. Two causes are suggested: (1) browsing pressure from introduced game animals, and (2) the impact of torrential water flow peaks after heavy winter rains, exacerbated by large-scale vegetation slashing in surrounding cork oak forests. We discuss conservation strategies for this and other relict tree species that account for the pecularities of their habitat within the. Mediterranean. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {I examined the long-term effects of cryptic mollusk herbivory on seven fitness components in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus and also calculated measures of total fitness effects. Natural correlations and experimental exclusion of mollusks showed that herbivory is associated with an increased probability of dying or staying dormant, poorer growth, and a lower probability of flowering. The average yearly reduction in population growth rate (lambda) caused by mollusks in the experiment was 0.14. The largest contribution to this decrease in total fitness occurred through a decreased survival of established plants. In contrast, seedling emergence and probability of flowering were the fitness components that were most affected in terms of relative change. The more important a life-cycle transition was for population growth rate in terms of its elasticity, the less it was affected by herbivore damage. These results suggest that simple analyses of the magnitudes of effects on individual components of plant performance are poor predictors of the magnitude of total fitness effects and tolerance to herbivory. This is because total fitness is differently sensitive to different phases of the life cycle and because plants strive to maintain the functions most important to fitness.},

abstract = {This synthesis builds on the preceding articles of this Special Section and has three goals. We first review the nascent literature that addresses indirect effects of hunting for tropical forest plant communities. Next, we highlight the potential indirect effects of hunting for other groups of organisms. Our final goal is to consider what could be done to ameliorate the demographic threats to harvest-sensitive game species caused by unsustainable hunting. Three conclusions are possible at this time concerning the impact of hunting for tropical forest plant communities: (1) Hunting tends to reduce seed movement for animal-dispersed species with very large diaspores; (2) Hunting reduces seed predation by granivorous vertebrates for species with large seeds; and (3) Hunting alters the species composition of the seedling and sapling layers. The cascading effects of hunting are already known to affect bruchid beetles and dung beetles and are likely to affect other, nongame taxa. To ameliorate these problems, several lines of research should be further explored to facilitate the development of game management plans including: (1) alternative use of sources of animal protein; (2) income supplementation for local people from sources other than wild meat; (3) outreach and extension activities for communities; (4) recognition and facilitation of the shifting of attitudes towards hunting; (5) implementation of community-based wildlife management programs in regulated-use areas such as extractive reserves; and (6) landscape-scale conservation planning that maximizes the source-sink dynamics of harvested and unharvested game populations and enforces game regulations in strictly protected areas.},

abstract = {Vertebrate coprolites (153 samples) in association with vertebrate and plant remains in the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) sediments of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation, in southeastern Coahuila, Mexico, represent at least ten morphotypes, ranging from ca. 1 cm to 3 cm. At least one suggests a carnivore origin due to the presence of abundant bone fragments, but most of the coprolite morphotypes were produced by either omnivores or herbivores. Analysis of inclusions of the coprolites revealed plant remains, such as stems and isolated vascular elements, and papillate and non- papillate cuticles. Two seed types have been recognized within two coprolite morphotypes. The first one has lythraceous affinity, being comparable to members of a morphological complex within Nesaeeae. The second seed type, which shows adaptations for water dispersal, belongs to Ranunculaceae, and is described as Eocaltha zoophila gen. et sp. nov. Although Eocaltha evolved a mechanism for abiotic dispersal, the seeds were apparently occasionally ingested by a vertebrate. The presence of seeds of E. zoophila in a coprolite suggests that the organism that produced it was looking for a high-quality diet perhaps represented by the seeds, and served indirectly as a biotic seed dispersal agent. The combination of abiotic and biotic dispersal syndromes, plus the fact that the seeds appear to be scarified suggest a case of diffuse coevolution. Interactions, as herbivory, during the Cretaceous prompted biotic dispersal of angiosperm diaspores as revealed by the presence of seeds of E, zooyhila. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {1. Large-seeded species have long been known to have higher survivorship during establishment than small-seeded species. Here, we assessed the size of this advantage by compiling published data on survival through seedling emergence, seedling establishment and sapling establishment.2. We found no relationship between seed mass and survival through the transition from viable seed in or on the soil to newly emerged seedlings (P = 0.47, n = 33 species).3. Synthesis of data from experimental studies on the advantages of large-seeded species establishing under particular hazards (such as shade, drought or herbivory) confirmed that seedlings of large-seeded species perform better than those of small-seeded species in most situations. However, the magnitude of this advantage was not sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1).4. Synthesis of data from field studies of populations under natural conditions also showed that large-seeded species have higher survival through early seedling establishment than small-seeded species (P = 0.006, n = 112 species). However, the magnitude of this advantage would only be sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1) if mortality continued at the same rate for some time.5. The time required for a species with 10-fold larger seeds to recoup the advantage gained by a smaller-seeded species during seed production ranged from 8.8 weeks for the smallest seeded species in the data set, up to an implausible 4.2 years for the largest-seeded species. Thus, while large-seeded species do have a survival advantage over small-seeded species during seedling establishment, the available evidence suggests that advantages must also accrue during other stages in the life cycle. One possibility is that the greater seed production of small-seeded species (m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1)) is partly offset by larger canopies and longer reproductive life spans in large-seeded species.},

abstract = {The number of interactions with flower visitor species differs considerably among insect pollinated plants. Knowing the causes for this variation is central to the conservation of single species as well as whole plant-flower visitor communities. Species specific constraints on flower visitor numbers are seldom investigated at the community level. In this study we tested whether flower size parameters set constraints on the morphology of the potential nectar feeding visitors and thus determine the number of visitor species. We studied three possible constraints: the depth and width of tubular structures hiding the nectar (nectar holder depth and width) and the size of flower parts that visitors can land on (size of the alighting place). In addition we assess the role of flower abundance on this relationship. We hypothesized that the stronger size constraints and the smaller flower abundance, the smaller the number of visitor species will be. Our study of a Mediterranean plant-flower visitor community revealed that nectar holder depth, nectar holder width and number of flowers explained 71{\%} of the variation in the number of visitor species. The size of the alighting place did not restrict the body length of the visitors and was not related to visitor species number. In a second step of the analyses we calculated for each plant species the potential number of visitors by determining for each insect species of the local visitor pool whether it passed the morphological limits set by the plant. These potential numbers were highly correlated with the observed numbers (r(2)=0.5, p {\textless} 0.001). For each plant species we tested whether the observed visitors were a random selection out of these potential visitors by comparing the mean of the observed and expected proboscis length distributions. For most plant species the observed mean was not significantly different from the random means. Our findings shed light on the way plant-flower visitor networks are structured. Knowing the constraints on interaction patterns will be an important prerequisite to formulate realistic null models and understand patterns of resource partitioning as well as coevolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Gene flow from transgenic crops can introduce novel traits into related species, but the ecological importance of this process is unknown. Here, we report the first empirical evidence that wild plants can benefit from a bacterial transgene under uncaged, natural conditions. Cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is known to hybridize frequently with wild sunflower (H. annuus) in the western and midwestern United States. We studied a crop-developed Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgene, cry1Ac, in backcrossed wild sunflower populations. Lepidopteran damage on transgenic plants was strongly reduced relative to control plants at our two study sites, while damage by several weevil and fly species was unaffected. Our results suggest that reduced herbivory caused transgenic plants to produce an average of 55{\%} more seeds per plant relative to nontransgenic controls at the field site in Nebraska. A similar but nonsignificant trend was seen at the site in Colorado (14{\%} more seeds per plant). In a greenhouse experiment the transgene had no effect on fecundity, suggesting that it was not associated with a fitness cost. If Bt sunflowers are released commercially, we expect that Bt genes will spread to wild and weedy populations, limit damage from susceptible herbivores on these plants, and increase seed production when these herbivores are common.},

In this paper we tested the hypothesis that the spatial scale experienced by all organism depends on its trophic level. We analyzed plant- herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid interactions in 15 agricultural landscapes differing in structural complexity using the rape pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus). and its parasitoids. In the very center of each landscape a patch of potted rape plants was placed in a grassy field margin strip for standardized measurement. Percent non-crop area of landscapes was negatively related to plant damage caused by herbivory and positively to the herbivores' larval mortality resulting from parasitism. In a geographic scale analysis, we quantified the structure of the 15 landscapes for eight circular sectors ranging from 0.5 to 6 kill diameter. Correlations between parasitism and non-crop areas as well as between herbivory and non-crop area were strongest at a scale of 1.5 kill, thereby not supporting the view that higher trophic levels experience the world at a larger spatial scale. However, the predictive power of non-crop area changed only slightly for herbivory, but greatly with respect to parasitism as scales from 0.5 to 1.5 kin and from 1.5 to 6 kill diameter increased. Furthermore, the effect of non-crop area tended to be stronger in parasitism than herbivory suggesting a greater effect of changes in landscape context oil parasitoids. This is in Support of the general idea that higher trophic levels Should be more Susceptible to disturbance.},

abstract = {Studies of coevolution in plant-herbivore systems have typically focused on tight, pairwise interactions between one herbivore and one host plant species. Diffuse coevolution, by contrast, has received much less empirical attention, presumably because imprecise definitions of diffuse coevolution have hindered the development of experimental approaches for distinguishing between pairwise and diffuse coevolution. Here we provide a definition of diffuse coevolution that leads to three criteria for the operation of pairwise coevolution: susceptibilities (resistances) to different herbivores are genetically uncorrelated, the presence/absence of one herbivore does not affect the amount of damage caused by other herbivores, and the impact of one herbivore on plant fitness does not depend on the presence/absence of other herbivores. All three criteria must be satisfied for coevolution to be pairwise; if any of them fail, coevolution is diffuse. We then describe an experimental design and statistical analysis that permit the partitioning of the total selection imposed on a plant by a set of herbivores into components representing pairwise and diffuse selection, thus allowing determination of whether coevolution is pairwise or diffuse.},

abstract = {The frequency of coevolution as a process of strong mutual interaction between a single plant and herbivore species has been questioned in light of more commonly observed, complex relationships between a plant and a suite of herbivore species. Despite recognition of the possibility of diffuse coevolution, relatively few studies have examined ecological responses of plants to herbivores in complex associations. We studied the impact of two specialist herbivores, the horse nettle beetle, Leptinotarsa juncta, and the eggplant flea beetle, Epitrix fuscula, on reproduction of their host, Solanum carolinense. Our study involved field and controlled-environment experimental tests of the impact on sexual and potential asexual reproduction of attack by individuals of the two herbivore species, individually and in combination. Field tests demonstrated that under normal levels of phytophagous insect attack, horse nettle plants experienced a reduction in fruit production of more than 75{\%} compared with plants from which insects were excluded. In controlled-environment experiments using enclosure-exclosure cages, the horse nettle's two principal herbivores, the flea beetle and the horse nettle beetle, caused decreases in sexual reproduction similar to those observed in the field, and a reduction in potential asexual reproduction, represented by root biomass. Attack by each herbivore reduced the numbers of fruits produced, and root growth, when feeding in isolation. When both species were feeding together, fruit production, but not root growth, was lower than when either beetle species fed alone. Ecological interactions between horse nettle and its two primary herbivores necessary for diffuse coevolution to occur were evident from an overall analysis of the statistical interactions between the two herbivores for combined assessment of fruit and vegetative traits. For either of these traits alone, the interactions necessary to promote diffuse coevolution apparently were lacking.},

This fact has spurred a large number of studies estimating heritabilities and genetic correlations in a variety of organisms. Most of these studies have been done in laboratory or greenhouse settings, but it is not well known how accurately these measurements estimate genetic variance and covariance expressed in the field. We conducted a quantitative genetic half-sibling analysis on six floral traits in wild radish. Plants were grown from seed in the field and were exposed to natural environmental variation throughout their lives, including herbivory and intra- and interspecific competition. The estimates of heritabilities and the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) obtained from this analysis were then compared to previous greenhouse estimates of the same floral traits from the same natural population. Heritabilities were much lower in the field for all traits, and this was due to both large increases in environmental variance and decreases in additive genetic variance. Additive genetic covariance expressed was also much lower in the field. These differences resulted in highly significant differences in the G matrix between the greenhouse and field environments using two complementary testing methods. Although the G matrices shared some principal components in common, they were not simply proportional to each other. Therefore, the greenhouse results did not accurately depict how the floral traits would respond to natural selection in the field.},

We examine and reject this hypothesis for an obligate mutualism between la subtropical New World fig (Ficus aurea) and its species- specific pollinator (Pegoscapus jimenezi). Fig wasps lay eggs within the flowers they pollinate; their offspring destroy a large proportion of fig's seeds. In a 6-year study of this interaction in Florida, U.S.A., we found that pollination intensity was in fact relatively high. Also contrary to expectations, reproductive success of both mutualists (as well as other wasps cohabiting the figs) was extremely variable and generally low, at three different scales of sampling: among figs from a single crop of one tree (thirty-four figs), among crops produced at different times by that tree (126 figs), and across trees over a 1-year period (379 figs). Although variable, fig contents were not completely unpredictable. For example, seed and wasp numbers increased with the number of flowers in a fig, and female and male flower numbers increased together. Little is yet known about the causes either of these relationships or of the massive fig-to-fig variation itself, although there is some evidence that they exist in other fig species as well. Further investigations of these patterns should shed new light on the ecology and evolution of this mutualism.},

abstract = {The interaction between Ficus (Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae; more than 700 species-specific couples) is one of the most specialized mutualisms found in nature. Both partners of this interaction show extensive variation in their respective biology. Here we investigate Ficus life-history trait evolution and fig/fig wasp coadaptation in the context of a well-resolved molecular phylogeny. Mapping out variations in Ficus life-history traits on an independently derived phylogeny constructed from ribosomal DNA sequences (external and internal transcribed spacer) reveals several parallel transitions in Ficus growth habit and breeding system. Convergent trait evolution might explain the discrepancies between morphological analyses and our molecular reconstruction of the genus. Morphological characters probably correlate with growth habit and breeding system and could therefore be subject to convergent evolution. Furthermore, we reconstruct the evolution of Ficus inflorescence characters that are considered adaptations to the pollinators. Our phylogeny reveals convergences in ostiole shape, stigma morphology, and stamen:ovule ratio. Statistical tests taking into account the phylogenetic relationship of the species show that transitions in ostiole shape are correlated with variation in wasp pollinator head shape, and evolutionary changes in stigma morphology and stamen:ovule ratio correlate with changes in the pollination behavior of the associated wasp. These correlations provide evidence for reciprocal adaptations of morphological characters between these mutualistic partners that have interacted over a long evolutionary time. In light of previous ecological studies on mutualism, we discuss the adaptive significance of these correlations and what they can tell us about the coevolutionary process occurring between figs and their pollinators.},

Using a coevolved interaction between a group of chrysomelid beetles and their host plants, I tested whether coexisting plants of the Mexican tropical dry forest tend to be chemically more dissimilar than random. Results show that some of the communities are chemically overdispersed and that overclispersion is related to the tightness of the interaction between plants and herbivores and the spatial scale at which communities are measured. As coevolutionary specialization increases and spatial scale decreases, communities tend to be more chemically dissimilar. At fairly local scales and where herbivores have tight one-to-one interactions with plants, communities have a strong pattern of chemical disparity.},

We studied the fig pollinator mutualism in 14 functionally dioecious fig species and one monoecious species from tropical lowland rainforests near Madang, Papua New Guinea. Observations and experiments suggest that (i) pollinating wasps are monophagous and attracted to a particular host species; (ii) pollinating and non-pollinating wasps are equally attracted to gall (male) figs and seed (female) figs in functionally dioecious species; (iii) differing style lengths between gall figs and seed figs may explain why pollinators do not develop in the latter; (iv) negative density dependence may stabilize the interaction between pollinating wasps and their parasitoids; and (v) seed figs may reduce the search efficiency of non-pollinators. This increased pollinator production without a corresponding decrease in seed production could provide an advantage for dioecy in conditions where pollinators are limiting.},

Lepidoptera and Diptera were represented mostly by larvae and pupae. Crustaceans of the orders Copepoda and Isopoda were also found. Plants were represented by seeds of species from secondary vegetation, mostly belonging to the families Piperaceae, Moraceae and Cecropiaceae, which should reflect frugivory. Predominance of arthropods in the diet was consistent with previous studies. Diet composition was remarkably constant among fragments, sexes, age classes, breeding versus non-breeding seasons, and climatic categories (dry versus humid months). The only significant difference was that diversity of arthropods was higher in the non-breeding than in the breeding season, but this was likely to be due to sampling effects. Given the natural abundances of the food items, the constancy of the diet is likely to reflect opportunism rather than food selection.},

Correlations among traits associated with herbivory and pollination may constrain the degree to which plants can evolve in response to any one interactor. Using the distylous plant, Gelsemium sempervirens, we tested the hypothesis that traits typically associated with pollination (distyly) and herbivore resistance (secondary compounds) were phenotypically correlated and examined how these traits influenced plant interactions with floral visitors. The flowers of G. sempervirens are visited by pollinators and a nectar robber, and the leaves and flowers express gelsemine, an alkaloid that is deterrent and sometimes toxic to visitors. Using an observational approach across five populations, we found the thrum floral morph (short-styled) expressed more leaf gelsemine than the pin morph (long-styled). Leaf gelsemine concentrations were positively correlated with flower gelsemine; however, there were no correlations between gelsemine and other floral morphological traits. Trait expression influenced pollination more so than robbing. Thrums received two times less pollen than pins. Moreover, across both morphs, pollen receipt was lower in plants that expressed higher levels of leaf gelsemine in two sites. These results imply that traits associated with pollination and herbivore resistance may not be independent.},

abstract = {``Reid's paradox'' is the mismatch between theoretical estimates of invasion rates for plants and ``observed'' rates of plant migration, particularly in the Holocene postglacial migration northwards. While Reid couched his paradox in terms of the migration of oaks in Great Britain, observers have documented the same problem in a wide variety of species. In almost all cases, these authors suggest that occasional, long-distance events, probably mitigated by active dispersal factors (ants, birds, rodents) are responsible. Clark and co-workers have shown that order statistics can bridge the gap between theory and predictions, essentially using ``fat-tailed'' dispersal kernels raised to high powers corresponding to rare, distant dispersal events. However, the spatial caching structure induced by most active dispersers has not been specifically examined. In this paper we develop a complementary approach to order statistics, based on the theory of homogenization, to describe the long-distance dispersal probabilities of seeds. The homogenization approach includes the spatial structure of active dispersal explicitly, and generates a corrective factor to current estimates of migration rates. This corrective factor is the ``caching scale ratio,'' the ratio of mean scatter-hoard size to mean separation between cache sites, and is, in principle. directly observable. The methodology is not limited to animal dispersers and can be used to address any set of dispersal agencies operating at differing scales, in one or more spatial dimensions. This approach is tested for three dispersal mutualisms where Reid's paradox is known to operate: harvester ant/wild ginger, Blue Jay/ oaks, and nutcracker/stone pine. Migration rates predicted using the homogenized approach compare favorably with estimates for tree species based on the paleo-ecological record. However, these rates do not seem to explain the Holocene migration of wild ginger.},

The result is a mixture of hotspots, where reciprocal selection is strong, and coldspots, where reciprocal selection is weak or absent, throughout the ranges of species. Population subdivision further provides the opportunity for nonadaptive forces, including gene flow, drift, and metapopulation dynamics, to influence the coevolutionary interaction between species. Some predicted results of this geographic mosaic of coevolution include maladapted or mismatched phenotypes, maintenance of high levels of polymorphism, and prevention of stable equilibrium trait combinations. To evaluate the potential for the geographic mosaic to influence predator-prey coevolution, we investigated the geographic pattern of genetically determined TTX resistance in the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis over much of the range of its ecological interaction with toxic newts of genus Taricha. We assayed TTX resistance in over 2900 garter snakes representing 333 families from 40 populations throughout western North America. Our results provide dramatic evidence that geographic structure is an important component in coevolutionary interactions between predators and prey. Resistance levels vary substantially (over three orders of magnitude) among populations and over short distances. The spatial array of variation is consistent with two areas of intense evolutionary response by predators ('hotspots') surrounded by clines of decreasing resistance. Some general predictions of the geographic mosaic process are supported, including clinal variation in phenotypes, polymorphism in some populations, and divergent outcomes of the interaction between predator and prey. Conversely, our data provide little support for one of the major predictions, mismatched values of interacting traits. Two lines of evidence suggest selection is paramount in determining population variation in resistance. First, phylogenetic information indicates that two hotspots of TTX resistance have evolved independently. Second, in the one region that TTX levels in prey have been quantified, resistance and toxicity levels match almost perfectly over a wide phenotypic and geographic range. However, these results do not preclude the role the nonadaptive forces in generating the overall geographic mosaic of TTX resistance. Much work remains to fill in the geographic pattern of variation among prey populations and, just as importantly, to explore the variation in the ecology of the interaction that occurs within populations.; },

abstract = {Scaling is relevant for the analysis of plant-frugivore interaction, since the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of seed dispersal depend on the spatial and temporal scale at which frugivory patterns emerge. We analyse the relationship between fruit abundance and frugivore activity at local and landscape spatial scales in two different systems composed, respectively, by the bird-dispersed woody plants Juniperus communis and Bursera fagaroides, and their frugivore assemblages. We use a hierarchical approach of nested patchiness of fruit-resource, where patches are defined by individual plants within site, at the local scale, and by sites within region, at the landscape scale. The structure of patches is also described in terms of contrast (differences in fruit availability among patches) and aggregation (spatial distribution of patches). For J. communis, frugivore activity was positively related to fruit availability at the landscape scale, this pattern seldom emerging at the local scale; conversely, B. fagaroides showed a general trend of positive local pattern that disappeared at the landscape scale. These particular trends might be partially explained by differences in contrast and aggregation. The strong contrast among plants within site together with a high aggregation among sites would promote the B. fagaroides pattern to be only local, whereas in J. communis, low aggregation among sites within region would favour a sharp landscape-scale pattern. Both systems showed discordant patterns of fruit-resource tracking among consecutive spatial scales, but the sense of discordance differed among systems. These results, and the available multi-scale frugivory data, suggest that discordance among successive scales allows to link directly frugivory patterns to resource-tracking mechanisms acting at particular scales, resulting, thus, more informative than concordance observational data, in which landscape patterns might result from accumulated effect of local mechanisms. In this context, we propose new methodological approaches for a better understanding of the hierarchical behavioural mechanisms underpinning the multi-scale resource tracking by frugivores.},

In 0.5-m(2) plots with 24 plants per plot, competition between Centaurea and Festuca was highly asymmetrical, with Centaurea strongly reducing the final biomass and reproduction of Festuca, and Festuca having no effect, or possibly a positive effect, on Centaurea. The direct effects of the biological control agents differed entirely. All Centaurea individuals died in plots receiving Sclerotinia, but Agapeta did not significantly reduce the growth of Centaurea, and apparently stimulated a compensatory reproductive response in the weed. Individual Centaurea plants that had been damaged by Agapeta produced more flowerheads, and the number of Centaurea plants with Agapeta root damage in a plot was positively correlated with total Centaurea biomass. These differences in the direct effects of the consumers were reflected in their indirect effects. In plots where Sclerotinia killed Centaurea (strong direct effects) Festuca growth and reproduction was equal to that in Festuca plots without Centaurea and the reproductive output of Festuca increased substantially (strong indirect effects). However, in the absence of Sclerotinia, the application of Agapeta did not significantly decrease Centaurea biomass (weak direct effects) and actually stimulated small, but significant decreases in Festuca reproduction and trends towards lower Festuca biomass (weak and opposite indirect effects - Agapeta does not eat Festuca). If the direct effects of biocontrol agents on Centaurea are weak, as suggested by our results, natives are unlikely to be released from the competitive effects of Centaurea, and natives may suffer from Centaurea's compensatory response to herbivory.},

Insects and plants are involved in diverse forms of mutualism. Here we review evolutionary features of three prominent insect-plant mutualisms: pollination, protection and seed dispersal. We focus on addressing five central phenomena: evolutionary origins and maintenance of mutualism; the evolution of mutualistic traits; the evolution of specialization and generalization; coevolutionary processes; and the existence of cheating. Several features uniting very diverse insect-plant mutualisms are identified and their evolutionary implications are discussed: the involvement of one mobile and one sedentary partner; natural selection on plant rewards; the existence of a continuum from specialization to generalization; and the ubiquity of cheating, particularly on the part of insects. Plant-insect mutualisms have apparently both arisen and been lost repeatedly. Many adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain these transitions, and it is unlikely that any one of them dominates across interactions differing so widely in natural history. Evolutionary theory has a potentially important, but as yet largely unfilled, role to play in explaining the origins, maintenance, breakdown and evolution of insect-plant mutualisms.},

In many moth-yucca interactions, oviposition leads to the failure of some ovules to develop normally. Here, we demonstrate that moth eggs almost always perish if they are inside these oviposition-induced 'damage zones' of developing fruit. Moreover, because more ovipositions result both in larger damage zones and in higher proportions of eggs within damage zones, this source of mortality is strongly density-dependent. Therefore, mortality of eggs in oviposition-induced damage zones may be an important process for limiting seed consumption and regulating moth densities in many moth-yucca mutualisms.},

Interaction patterns can be visualized and analyzed either as matrices, as bipartite networks or as multivariate sets through correspondence analysis. We argue that differences among patterns represent outcomes of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes in these highly diversified assemblages. Instead of choosing one model a priori, assemblages should be probed for a suite of patterns. A plant-pollinator assemblage exemplifies a simple nested pattern, whereas a plant-herbivore assemblage illustrates a compound pattern with nested structures within compartments. Compartmentation should reflect coevolutionary histories and constraints, whereas differences in species abundance or dispersal may generate nestedness.},

We looked for correlation across nine Iberian localities, between diaspore traits and structural and functional characteristics of ant communities.2 Mean diaspore traits did not show a distance-dependent pattern. Seed size-related traits (length, width, diaspore mass and seed mass) varied mostly among localities and ant reward-related traits (elaiosome mass and elaiosome to seed mass ratio) mainly within plants.3 Ant communities showed distance-dependent patterns in composition and abundance. Almost all ant species responded positively to diaspore offerings and preferred seeds with elaiosomes. The extent of the preference differed among species and was affected by ant size. Ant size was however, similar in almost all localities and the quality of the disperser guild, estimated as the ant response to seed offerings, did not vary.4 We found a large-scale lack of adjustment: seed traits could not be predicted from ant community composition or geographical distance. Nor could structural and functional ant community parameters explain variation in seed traits.5 Comparison of ant sizes, position on a Principal Components Analysis of seed traits, and indirect estimates of dispersal success, suggests that there is a mosaic of well-matched and mismatched situations which probably obscures the overall relationships among seed traits and ant assemblages.

abstract = {The consumption of figs (the fruit of Ficus spp.: Moraceae) by vertebrates is reviewed using data from the literature, unpublished accounts and new field data from Borneo and Hong Kong. Records of frugivory from over 75 countries are presented for 260 Ficus species (approximately 30{\%} of described species). Explanations are presented for geographical and taxonomic gaps in the otherwise extensive literature. In addition to a small number of reptiles and fishes, 1274 bird and mammal species in 523 genera and 92 families are known to eat figs. In terms of the number of species and genera of fig-eaters and the number of fig species eaten we identify the avian families interacting most with Ficus to be Columbidae, Psittacidae, Pycnonotidae, Bucerotidae, Sturnidae and Lybiidae. Among mammals, the major fig-eating families are Pteropodidae, Cercopithecidae, Sciuridae, Phyllostomidae and Cebidae. We assess the role these and other frugivores play in Ficus seed dispersal and identify fig-specialists. In most, but not all, cases fig specialists provide effective seed dispersal services to the Ficus species on which they feed. The diversity of fig-eaters is explained with respect to fig design and nutrient content, phenology of fig ripening and the diversity of fig presentation. Whilst at a gross level there exists considerable overlap between birds, arboreal mammals and fruit bats with regard to the fig species they consume, closer analysis, based on evidence from across the tropics, suggests that discrete guilds of Ficus species differentially attract subsets of sympatric frugivore communities. This dispersal guild structure is determined by interspecific differences in fig design and presentation. Throughout our examination of the fig-frugivore interaction we consider phylogenetic factors and make comparisons between large-scale biogeographical regions. Our dataset supports previous claims that Ficus is the most important plant genus for tropical frugivores. We explore the concept of figs as keystone resources and suggest criteria for future investigations of their dietary importance. Finally, fully referenced lists of frugivores recorded at each Ficus species and of Ficus species in the diet of each frugivore are presented as online appendices. In situations where ecological information is incomplete or its retrieval is impractical, this valuable resource will assist conservationists in evaluating the role of figs or their frugivores in tropical forest sites.},

abstract = {Figs (Ficus spp.) are well known for their species-specific interactions with pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae). Many other highly specific but nonpollinating species develop within fig inflorescences (syconia) as well. Like the majority of species that exploit coevolved mutualisms, most aspects of their biology are virtually unknown. Here, I report on the three undescribed wasp species (Chalcidoidea: Torymidae: Sycophaginae) commonly associated with a neotropical fig (Ficus pertusa), focusing on their dependence on the mutualism between F. pertusa and its pollinator Pegoscapus silvestrii, and their impact upon it. Depending on the feeding habits of larval nonpollinators, their presence within syconia may or may not be costly to figs and pollinators. Indirect evidence suggests that the species exploiting F. pertusa feed on nourishing tissue that they induce within fig ovaries that are unexploited by the pollinators, rather than on developing pollinators or seeds. Thus, in this case any costs to the mutualists should be indirect and probably small. In this study, they were so small as to be unmeasurable. The ubiquity of nonpollinators in figs and the lack of effective defenses against them may be due in part of this weak impact on their hosts. F. pertusa's three torymid species are highly dependent on the fig/pollinator interaction at two stages. First, they can only reproduce if females have oviposited within pollinated syconia, since trees abscise nearly all unpollinated ones early in development. Torymid oviposition was in fact delayed relative to pollination, and in the one species investigated, females discriminated among syconia and chose to oviposit in the pollinated ones. Second, the torymids' offspring depend on the pollinators' male offspring to create an escape passage out of the mature syconium. Possibly for this reason, maturation times of all wasp species within the syconium are highly synchronized. Many traits involved in this dependence on the fig/pollinator mutualism are similar among torymids inhabiting the same fig species. These traits appear to represent convergent evolution among diverse, unrelated torymid species rather than similarity by descent. Nonpollinator species that depend on the fig/pollinator interaction at these stages are those most likely to be associated with a single fig/pollinator pair, since synchronization with the obligate pollinator's life cycle is most critical for them.},

Yet the theory of coevolution of mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction. However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect, establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.},

abstract = {Coevolved mutualisms, such as those between senita cacti, yuccas, and their respective obligate pollinators, benefit both species involved in the interaction. However, in these pollination mutualisms the pollinator's larvae impose a cost on plants through consumption of developing seeds and fruit. The effects of pollinators on benefits and costs are expected to vary with the abundance of pollinators, because large population sizes result in more eggs and larval seed-eaters. Here, we develop the hypothesis that fruit abortion, which is common in yucca, senita, and plants in general, could in some cases have the function of limiting pollinator abundance and, thereby, increasing fruit production. Using a general steady-state model of fruit production and pollinator dynamics, we demonstrate that plants involved in pollinating seed-eater mutualisms can increase their fecundity by randomly aborting fruit. We show that the ecological conditions under which fruit abortion can improve plants fecundity are not unusual. They are best met when the plant is long-lived, the population dynamics of the pollinator are much faster than those of the plant, the loss of one fruit via abortion kills a larva that would have the expectation of destroying more than one fruit through its future egg laying as an adult moth, and the effects of fruit abortion on pollinator abundance are spatially localized. We then use the approach of adaptive dynamics to find conditions under which a fruit abortion strategy based on regulating the pollinator population could feasibly evolve in this type of plant-pollinator interaction.

This possibility has been confirmed through simulation studies and suggested for some empirical systems in which disassortative mating by disease resistance genotype has been documented. The generality of this phenomenon is unclear, however, because existing theory has considered only a subset of possible genetic and mating scenarios. Here we present results from analytical models that consider a broader range of genetic and mating scenarios and allow the evolution of non-random mating in the parasite as well. Our results confirm results of previous simulation studies, demonstrating that coevolutionary interactions with parasites can indeed lead to the evolution of host disassortative mating. However, our results also show that the conditions under which this occurs are significantly more fickle than previously thought, requiring specific forms of infection genetics and modes of non-random mating that do not generate substantial sexual selection. In cases where such conditions are not met, hosts may evolve random or assortative mating. Our analyses also reveal that coevolutionary interactions with hosts cause the evolution of non-random mating in parasites as well. In some cases, particularly those where mating occurs within groups, we find that assortative mating evolves sufficiently to catalyze sympatric speciation in the interacting species.},

abstract = {Primate frugivory may reduce density-dependent predation on seeds and seedlings via effective seed dispersal. Accordingly, the tendency of cercopithecines to spit and scatter seeds {\textgreater} 4 mm wide could represent a prominent means of dispersal. However, the importance of seed-spitting may vary according to the life history adaptations of plants. Indeed, the actions of cercopithecines may be incongruent with the reproductive biology of plants that rely on large frugivores to swallow and defecate their seeds. This possibility raises conservation concerns because large frugivores are often susceptible to extirpation or extinction from hunting and habitat fragmentation. It is therefore important to determine if cercopithecines have a compensatory effect; that is, whether or not seed-spitting effectively conveys large seeds to recruitment sites. To test this concept, we used geospatial techniques to measure and analyze the dispersion of tree species dispersed by elephants, chimpanzees, and cercopithecines to different spatial extents. We studied adult trees of Balanites wilsoniana, Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, and Uvariopsis congensis in a 2.2-ha plot in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Despite the tendency of cercopithecines to spit the seeds of Uvariopsis congensis, adult trees were highly clumped, with a modal nearest-neighbor distance of {\textless} 5 m and a crown overlap of 1.5 m. Virtually identical results for Balanites wilsoniana and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, the seeds of which are not spat, suggest that seed-spitting may be a poor mechanism of dispersal for some large-seeded plants.},

abstract = {Much of the dynamics of coevolution may be driven by the interplay between geographic variation in reciprocal selection (selection mosaics) and the homogenizing action of gene flow. We develop a genetic model of geographically structured coevolution in which gene flow links coevolving communities that may differ in both the direction and magnitude of reciprocal selection. The results show that geographically structured coevolution may lead to allele-frequency dines within both interacting species when fitnesses are spatially uniform or spatially heterogeneous. Furthermore, the results show that the behavior and shape of dines differ dramatically among different types of coevolutionary interaction. Antagonistic interactions produce dynamic dines that change shape rapidly through time, producing shifting patterns of local adaptation and maladaptation. Unlike antagonistic interactions, mutualisms generate stable equilibrium patterns that lead to fixed spatial patterns of adaptation. Interactions that vary between mutualism and antagonism produce both equilibrium and dynamic dines. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that these interactions may allow mutualisms to persist throughout the geographic range of an interaction, despite pockets of locally antagonistic selection. In all cases, the coevolved spatial patterns of allele frequencies are sensitive to the relative contributions of gene flow, selection, and overall habitat size, indicating that the appropriate scale for studies of geographically structured coevolution depends on the relative contributions of each of these factors.},

abstract = {We develop an approach for studying population dynamics resulting from mutualism by employing functional responses based on density-dependent benefits and costs. These functional responses express how the population growth rate of a mutualist is modified by the density of its partner. We present several possible dependencies of gross benefits and costs, and hence net effects, to a mutualist as functions of the density of its partner. Net effects to mutualists are likely a monotonically saturating or unimodal function of the density of their partner. We show that fundamental differences in the growth, limitation, and dynamics of a population can occur when net effects to that population change linearly, unimodally, or in a saturating fashion. We use the mutualism between senita cactus and its pollinating seed-eating moth as an example to show the influence of different benefit and cost functional responses on population dynamics and stability of mutualisms. We investigated two mechanisms that may alter this mutualism's functional responses: distribution of eggs among flowers and fruit abortion. Differences in how benefits and costs vary with density can alter the stability of this mutualism. In particular, fruit abortion may allow for a stable equilibrium where none could otherwise exist.},

abstract = {Species interactions are a major source of adaptive radiation. In mutualisms, such diversification can take the form of evolution of parasites that exploit the resources needed for maintenance of the mutualism. Mutualistic associations often have associated parasitic species, and in some cases, parasitic species have indeed evolved from the mutualists. For example, obligate mutualisms, such as those involving seed-eating pollinators, have on a few occasions given rise to nonmutualist species. These systems are relatively simple and provide models for identifying factors that facilitate the stable reversal of a mutualistic interaction. We used ecological data in a phylogenetic framework to analyze the origins of two nonmutualist cheater yucca moths. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of cheating may be preceded by a change in oviposition behavior. Two different modes of oviposition among math species cause density-dependent moth egg mortality through flower abscission in one case (locule-ovipositing species) but density-independent mortality in the other (superficially ovipositing species). A mtDNA-based phylogeny indicated that cheating and superficial oviposition have evolved twice each and that the cheater clades are sisters to the superficially ovipositing species clades. Consideration of the fitness consequences of two trait changes-loss of pollination and phenological delay in oviposition-in which cheaters have diverged from ancestral pollinators suggest that the shift to oviposition into fruit may have occurred first and that loss of pollination behavior was a secondary event. We suggest that secondary coexistence of two pollinator species of opposite oviposition modes may facilitate the shift to fruit oviposition and cheating and that this is applicable in the best documented of the cheater lucca moths. Superficially ovipositing species suffer dual sources of egg mortality when in coexistence with locule-ovipositing species. Shift to fruit oviposition under this circumstance can be facilitated by access to a seed resource not available to the copollinator, preadaptations in ovipositor morphology, and pollinator phenology late relative to the copollinator. Thus the adaptive radiation of nonmutualists from mutualists may have taken place in specific ecological contexts through few trait changes, and the reversal of mutualism would be a by-product of a shift to reliance on a previously inaccessible seed resource.},

In this paper, we study the effects of herbivory and the protective role of woody shrubs in the regeneration ability of the yew in the Sierra Nevada. The estimated density of the yew in the study plot was 287.9 individuals/ha, more than 90{\%} being juveniles (seedlings and saplings), which were mostly located under fleshy-fruited shrubs. Saplings suffered serious herbivore damage when unprotected by shrubs. Thus, fleshy-fruited shrubs proved to be the best habitat fur seedling establishment and sapling survival and growth. The abundance of fleshy-fruited shrubs in our study site provides a yew population characterized by an active regeneration under natural conditions. We suggest that the maintenance of healthy populations of yew in Mediterranean mountains is strongly dependent on the conservation of well-developed fleshy-fruit understories and their community of avian dispersers.

abstract = {Numerous studies have documented declines in plant diversity in response to habitat loss in fragmented landscapes. However, determining the mechanisms that lead to species loss is challenging using solely a correlative approach. Here we link correlative assessments of plant community composition with seed additions for a focal species to test the hypothesis that distributions of forests plants within a fragmented landscape are limited by seed dispersal. Woody plant species richness of fragments declined as fragments (n=26) became more isolated by agricultural fields. We predicted that if these isolation effects were driven by poor dispersal rather than other effects associated with habitat loss, then plants should vary in their response to isolation in relation to their seed size (i.e., stronger effects for plants with larger seeds). As predicted under this dispersal limitation hypothesis, sensitivity of bird-dispersed shrubs to isolation was related to their seed mass, with species with heavy seeds (e.g., Lindera benzoin) exhibiting stronger declines in presence across isolation gradients than species with light seeds. Seed addition experiments were performed for Lindera benzoin in two high isolation forest fragments (nearest neighbor mean distance=803 m) where Lindera was naturally absent, and two low isolation fragments (nearest neighbor mean distance=218 m) with naturally occurring Lindera populations. Seed addition and control plots (n=50 1 m(2) plots per fragment) were monitored for 13 censuses over 3 years. Across all four fragments, seed additions resulted in significant increases in Lindera seedling recruitment with no differences in final seedling establishment among fragments. However, insect herbivory was higher on Lindera seedlings in high isolation compared to low isolation fragments and was negatively correlated with seedling survival over some years. Consistent with prior work, our results confirm that seed dispersal plays a significant role in affecting plant diversity in fragmented landscapes. However, results also suggest the need for a better understanding of how additional processes, such as herbivory, may be altered as habitat is lost and what effects such changes have for forest plants.},

abstract = {Nursery pollination in Caryophyllaceae species by Hadena and Perizoma moths has been extensively described in the last few decades. Evidence across multiple pairs of species shows that such pollination systems constitute relatively specialized interactions, shifting between parasitism and mutualism depending on the presence of effective co-pollinators.In this work, we describe a new specific Silene-Hadena interaction, the Silene ciliata-Hadena consparcatoides system. Although S. ciliata presents a typical nocturnal pollination syndrome, diurnal flower visitors have also been recorded, which motivated us to evaluate the costs and benefits of this nursery moth pollination to the plant. We experimentally induced two pollination regimes at non-overlapping day-night periods in a natural population of S. ciliata, and compared their effects on plant reproductive success from flower to seedling stages. Flower scent composition of S. ciliata and antennal responses of H. consparcatoides to this scent were recorded to evaluate the specificity of olfactory signals in this interaction system.In accordance with its nocturnal pollination syndrome, S. ciliata emitted a greater amount of flower scent compounds during the night. Some of the predominant scent compounds, such as benzaldehyde, benzyl acetate and methyl salicylate elicited signals in the antennae of H. consparcatoides. Diurnal pollination produced more fruits per flower than nocturnal pollination, but the latter produced higher brood size resulting in similar overall fecundity. However, seeds generated from diurnal pollination were heavier and germinated better. We conclude that despite its nocturnal pollination syndrome, S. ciliata achieved similar reproductive success and higher offspring vigour under the diurnal pollinator regime. Although H. consparcatoides is specialized in S. ciliata, its shortage or absence would not jeopardize the reproductive success of its host plant. On the contrary, the seed predation exerted by this nursery pollinator shifts the interaction towards parasitism.},

abstract = {Pollinator-mediated selection is one of the most important factors driving adaptation in flowering plants. However, as ecological conditions change through habitat loss and fragmentation, the interactions among species may evolve in new and unexpected directions. Human-induced environmental variation is likely to affect selection regimes, but as yet no empirical examples have been reported. In the study reported here, we examined the influence of human-induced habitat transformation on the composition of pollinator assemblages and, hence, pollinator-mediated selection on the flower phenotype of Viola portalesia (Violaceae). Our results indicate that pollinator assemblages differed substantially in terms of species composition and visitation rate between nearby native and transformed habitats. Similarly, the insect species that contributed most to visitation rates differed between plant populations. While the magnitude and sign of pollinator-mediated selection on flower length and width did not differ between sites, selection for flower number lost significance in the transformed habitat, and a significant pattern of disruptive selection for flower shape, undetected in the native habitat, was present in the transformed one. Overall, the results of this study suggest that human-induced habitat change may not only modify the species composition of pollinator assemblages, relaxing the selection process on some flower characters, but they may also create new opportunities for fitness-trait covariation not present in pristine conditions.},

Cooperation may nevertheless persist despite one-sided opportunities for cheating, provided that the partner vulnerable to exploitation has sufficient control over the duration of interaction. Here we develop a simple, game theoretical model of this form of partner control. We show that as a victim's ability to terminate an encounter increases, selection can favour reduced exploitation, resulting in a switch from parasitism to mutualism. For a given level of control, exploitation is likely to be less intense and the interaction to last longer when there are greater mutualistic benefits to be gained, and when the benefits of cheating are lower relative to the costs inflicted on the victim.

According to the theory, much of this local maladaptation is driven by selection mosaics and spatially intermingled coevolutionary hot and cold spots, rather than a simple balance between gene flow and selection. Here I develop a genetic model of host-parasite coevolution that is sufficiently general to incorporate selection mosaics, coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and a diverse array of genetic systems of infection/resistance. Results from this model show that the selection mosaics experienced by the interacting species are an important determinant of the sign and magnitude of local maladaptation. In some cases, this effect may be stronger than a previously described effect of relative rates of parasite and host gene flow. These results provide the first theoretical evidence that selection mosaics and coevolutionary hot and cold spots per se determine the magnitude and sign of local maladaptation. At the same time, however, these results demonstrate that coevolution in a geographic mosaic can lead to virtually any pattern of local adaptation or local maladaptation. Consequently, empirical studies that describe only patterns of local adaptation or maladaptation do not provide evidence either for or against the theory.},

Fruiting phenology was compared among two representative syndromes, such as bird-monkey syndrome (BM) and ruminant-rodent-elephant syndrome (RRE), plus the gravity dispersal species for comparison, in south-western Cameroon in order to examine which biotic or abiotic factors educed syndrome variation. The individual size of selected plants ({\textgreater} 1.6 m in height) was recorded in a 16.95-ha area for recruitment estimation and their fruiting behaviour was checked for 9 months from June 1985 to February 1986. The BM species, a suggested successful group, fruited in a less synchronous manner within species and had fruiting peaks just before and during the rainy season. The RRE species, a suggested failing group, showed greater variation within syndrome in fruiting timing, duration and synchronization. Results obtained supported no clear phenological response to corresponding vertebrates except for the case of Sacoglottis gabonensis in the RRE. The reason for concealing potential responses is probably a result of conflicting requirements for seed dispersal and offspring survival. Periodical fruiting of the BM is likely to reflect ecological constraint, such as water stress on seedlings, caused from syndrome-specific morphological limitation. In this case, the animals have indirect effects on fruiting phenology through selecting syndrome-specific fruit morphology. The greater variation of the RRE suggests a broad spectrum of dispersal tactics from faithful zoochory to alternatives, with a trade off between agent restriction and seed size and another trade off between parental investment and seed-predation risk.},

abstract = {Herbivore damage is generally detrimental to plant fitness, and the evolutionary response of plant populations to damage can involve either increased resistance or increased tolerance. While characters that contribute to resistance, such as secondary chemicals and trichomes, are relatively well understood, characters that contribute to a plant's ability to tolerate damage have received much less attention. Using Helianthus annuus (wild sunflower) and simulated damage of Haplorhynchites aeneus (head-clipping weevil) as a model system, we examined morphological characters and developmental processes that contribute to compensatory ability. We performed a factorial experiment that included three levels of damage (none, the first two, or the first four inflorescences were clipped with scissors) and eight sires each mated to four dams. We found that plants compensated fully for simulated head-clipper damage and that there was no variation among plant families in compensatory ability: seed production and mean-seed mass did not vary among treatments, and sire X treatment interactions were not significant. Plants used four mechanisms to compensate for damage: (1) Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences than unclipped plants. Plants produced these additional inflorescences on higher order branches at the end of the flowering season. (2) Clipped plants filled significantly more seeds in their remaining heads than did unclipped plants. (3) Clipped plants, because they effectively flowered later than unclipped plants, were less susceptible to damage by seed-feeding herbivores other than Haplorhynchites. (4) In later heads, seed size was greater on clipped plants, which allowed mean seed size to be maintained in clipped plants. Although there was genetic variation among the families used in this experiment for most of the characters associated with compensation for damage (seed number, mean seed size, mean flowering date, length of the flowering period, and branching morphology), in analyses of these characters, no sire X treatment interactions were significant indicating that all of the families relied on Similar mechanisms to compensate for damage.; },

abstract = {Many host species interact with a specific parasite within only a fraction of their geographical range. Where host and parasite overlap geographically, selection may be reciprocal constituting a coevolutionary hot spot. Host evolution, however, may be driven primarily by selection imposed by alternative biotic or abiotic factors that occur outside such hot spots. To evaluate the importance of coevolutionary hot spots for host and parasite evolution, we analyse a spatially explicit genetic model for a host that overlaps with a parasite in only part of its geographical range. Our results show that there is a critical amount of overlap beyond which reciprocal selection leads to a coevolutionary response in the host. This critical amount of overlap depends upon the explicit spatial configuration of hot spots. When the amount of overlap exceeds this first critical level, host-parasite coevolution commonly generates stable allele frequency clines rather than oscillations. It is within this region that one of the primary predictions of the geographic mosaic theory is realized, and local maladaptation is prevalent in both species. Past a further threshold of overlap between the species oscillations do evolve, but allele frequencies in both species are spatially synchronous and local maladaptation is absent in both species. A consequence of such transitions between coevolutionary dynamics is that parasite adaptation is inversely proportional to the fraction of its host's range that it occupies. Hence, as the geographical range of a parasite increases, it becomes increasingly maladapted to the host. This suggests a novel mechanism through which the geographical range of parasites may be limited.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that mutualisms, interspecific interactions that benefit both species, have been grossly neglected relative to their true importance in nature. I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22{\%} of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90{\%} of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 {\%}) and seed dispersal (31 {\%}), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 {\%}) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.},

abstract = {Traits associated with seed dispersal vary tremendously among sympatric wind-dispersed plants. We used two contrasting tropical tree species, seed traps, micrometeorology, and a mechanistic model to evaluate how variation in four key traits affects seed dispersal by wind. The conceptual framework of movement ecology, wherein external factors (wind) interact with internal factors (plant traits) that enable movement and determine when and where movement occurs, fully captures the variable inputs and outputs of wind dispersal models and informs their interpretation. We used model calculations to evaluate the spatial pattern of dispersed seeds for the 16 factorial combinations of four traits. The study species differed dramatically in traits related to the timing of seed release, and a strong species by season interaction affected most aspects of the spatial pattern of dispersed seeds. A rich interplay among plant traits and seasonal differences in atmospheric conditions caused this interaction. Several of the same plant traits are crucial for both seed dispersal and other aspects of life history variation. Observed traits that limit dispersal are likely to be constrained by their life history consequences.},

abstract = {We identified volatiles from the floral headspace of Yucca filamentosa using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and analyzed floral scent composition and variation among populations pollinated by different yucca moth species. Twenty-one scent compounds were repeatedly identified and most could be categorized into two major classes: (1) homoterpenes derived from the sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol and (2) long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. Two biosynthetic pathways are thus responsible for the majority of floral volatiles in Y. filamentosa. The homoterpene E-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene, which is released systemically by higher plants upon herbivory, was the most abundant compound. Two di-oxygenated compounds not previously reported as floral compounds also were detected. No differentiation in floral scent was observed between populations pollinated by different yucca moths, nor was there any correlation between chemical distance and geographic distance among populations. The total release rate of volatiles differed significantly among populations, but not between populations with different pollinators. The combination of unique compounds and low variation in the fragrance blend may reflect highly selective attraction of obligate pollinators to flowers. The observed lack of differentiation in floral scent can putatively explain high moth-mediated gene flow among sites, but it does not explain conservation of odor composition across populations with different pollinators.},

In experiments with paired Cupania vernalis (Sapindaceae) saplings in a semi-deciduous forest in south-east Brazil, we blocked leaf domatia to examine their effect: (1) on mites and other arthropods, and (2) on damage caused by fungi and herbivorous arthropods. In general, plants with resin-blocked domatia had fewer predaceous mites on leaves than control plants with unaltered domatia, but the total abundances of fungivorous and of phytophagous mites remained unchanged. However, phytophagous eriophyid mites, the most numerous inhabitants of domatia, decreased on leaf surfaces with the blocking treatment. In a second experiment, treated plants lacking functional domatia developed significantly greater numbers and areas of chlorosis, apparently due to increased eriophyid attacks, whereas fungal attack, epiphyll abundance and leaf-area loss were unaffected. This seems to be the first experimental study to demonstrate that leaf domatia can benefit plants against herbivory in a natural system. The possible stabilizing effect of leaf domatia on predator-prey interactions is discussed.},

abstract = {Tropical forests include a diversity of habitats, which has led to specialization in plants. Near Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, nutrient-rich clay forests surround nutrient-poor white-sand forests, each harboring a unique composition of habitat specialist trees. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of impoverished soils and herbivory creates strong natural selection for plant defenses in white-sand forest, while rapid growth is favored in clay forests. Recently, we reported evidence from a reciprocal-transplant experiment that manipulated the presence of herbivores and involved 20 species from six genera including phylogenetically independent pairs of closely related white-sand and clay specialists. When protected from herbivores, clay specialists exhibited faster growth rates than white-sand specialists in both habitats. But, when unprotected, white-sand specialists outperformed clay specialists in white-sand habitat, and clay specialists outperformed white-sand specialists in clay habitat. Here we test further the hypothesis that the growth-defense trade-off contributes to habitat specialization by comparing patterns of growth, herbivory, and defensive traits in these same six genera of white-sand and clay specialists. While the probability of herbivore attack did not differ between the two habitats, an artificial defoliation experiment showed that the impact of herbivory on plant mortality was significantly greater in white-sand forests. We quantified the amount of terpenes, phenolics, leaf toughness, and available foliar protein for the plants in the experiment. Different genera invested in different defensive strategies, and we found strong evidence for phylogenetic constraint in defense type. Overall, however, we found significantly higher total defense investment for white-sand specialists, relative to their clay specialist congeners. Furthermore, herbivore resistance consistently exhibited a significant trade-off against growth rate in each of the six phylogenetically independent species-pairs. These results confirm theoretical predictions that a trade-off exists between growth rate and defense investment, causing white-sand and clay specialists to evolve divergent strategies. We propose that the growth-defense trade-off is universal and provides an important mechanism by which herbivores govern plant distribution patterns across resource gradients.},

abstract = {We investigate the coevolution of time of flowering and time of pollinator emergence in an obligate association between a plant and an insect that both pollinates and parasitizes flowers. Numerical analysis shows that the system in general evolves towards a time of flowering different from the time favoured by the abiotic environment. The equilibrium towards which the system evolves is a local fitness maximum (an ESS) with respect to mutational variation in flowering time but, for the insect, it can be a local fitness minimum at which selection on mutational variation in the time of insect emergence is disruptive. A consequence of evolutionary convergence to a fitness minimum is that pollinators having an earlier phenology can coexist with pollinators having a later phenology. Since late emerging insects are more likely to encounter and oviposit within previously pollinated flowers, their effect on the plant is more exploitative, leading them to function as cheaters within the system. Thus, in the long term, pollinators and exploiters are likely to be found in stable coexistence in pollinating seed-parasite systems. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Pollen removal and deposition was studied in the specialised pollination mutualism between the perennial, partly self- incompatible, herb Aconitum septentrionale (Ranunculaceae) and the long-tongued specialist bee Bombus consobrinus (Apidae). Aconitum septentrionale was also visited by three less abundant generalist bumblebees. Bombus consobrinus was also visiting a few other plants before and after flowering of A. septentrionale. Workers of specialist and generalist bumblebees removed similar amounts of pollen per visit. Queens of the specialist species removed less than worker bees. Flower visit duration was the same for queens as for workers of the specialist. However, both workers and queens of the specialist made shorter visits and thus removed more pollen per unit time than did the two most frequent generalists. Thus the specialist showed a higher efficiency (net energy gain per unit time) as a harvester than the generalists. The proportion of the total pollen production removed by the specialist was similar to that found in other mutualism studies. The proportion of the variation in amount of pollen left in a flower after a visit that could be explained by the combined effects of total pollen production per fewer and Bower visit duration was less for B. consobrinus than for the two most frequent generalists and also less than seen in other comparable studies in the literature. Workers of B. consobrinus were the only abundant depositors of pollen in flowers of A. septentrionale. Visit duration to female phased flowers explained most of the variation in number of pollen deposited on stigmas. 1{\%} of total pollen production reached conspecific stigmas. Thus B. consobrinus was the only quantitatively important pollinator of A. septentrionale.},

abstract = {Interactions between ants and ant-plants are considered classic examples of obligate mutualisms. Previous studies have indicated that for many ant-plants the loss of ant colonies results in severe defoliation or mortality. Although individual plants can persist for some period of time without their mutualistic partners, to date populations of ant-free plants have only been recorded at high altitudes or on remote islands where herbivores are also scarce. We studied the interaction between ants, herbivores, and the ant-plant Tococa guianensis in the Cerrado region of central Brazil. Using a survey conducted across a large geographic region, we show that there is interpopulation variation in ant occupancy across sites and habitats. At most sites surveyed, plants were inhabited by Allomerus octoarticulatus, an obligate plant-ant. Plants with obligate ants had significantly lower standing levels of herbivore damage than plants with opportunistic ants and plants with no ant occupants. Furthermore, experimental removal of A. octoarticulatus resulted in increased levels of damage in both young and mature leaves. Despite the protection provided by obligate ants, populations of T. guianensis were found to persist without these ants in some areas. Plants without A. octoarticulatus had significantly greater leaf toughness and trichome density than those with A. octoarticulatus. Furthermore, trichome density in plants with A. octoarticulatus increased after ants were removed, probably as a response induced by increased levels of herbivore damage. To our knowledge, this is the first record of the occurrence of native myrmecophyte populations without their mutualistic ants in mainland low-elevation sites. Several factors may help to explain the long-term persistence of T. guianensis populations without plant-ants in some areas of the Brazilian Cerrado, including its potential for induced morphological defenses against insect herbivores and selection for increased levels of constitutive defenses. In addition, T. guianensis may be under lower herbivore pressure in the sites we studied than in other parts of its range because existing populations were small, isolated, and some were very close to the edge of this species' distribution.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a vigorous interest in community ecology about the structure of mutualistic networks and its importance for species persistence and coevolution. However, the mechanisms shaping mutualistic networks have been rarely explored. Here we extend for the first time the neutral theory of biodiversity to a multi trophic system. We focus on nestedness, a distinctive pattern of mutualistic community assembly showing two characteristics, namely, asymmetrical specialization (specialists interacting with generalists) and a generalist core (generalists interacting with generalists). We investigate the importance of relative species abundance (RSA) for the nested assembly of plant-animal mutualistic networks. Our results show that neutral mutualistic communities give rise to networks considerably more nested than real communities. RSA explains 60-70{\%} of nested patterns in two real communities studied here, while 30-40{\%} of nestedness is still unexplained. The nested pattern in real communities is better explained when we introduce interaction-specific species traits such as forbidden links and intensity of dependence (relative importance of fruits for the diet of a frugivore) in our analysis. The fact that neutral mutualistic communities exhibit a perfectly nested structure and do not show a random or compartmentalized structure, underlines the importance of RSA in the assembly of mutualistic networks.},

We found that selection (directional) by crossbills on lodgepole pine where Tamiasciurus are absent was divergent from the selection (directional) exerted by Tamiasciurus on lodgepole pine. This resulted in divergent selection between areas with and without Tamiasciurus that was congruent with the geographic patterns of cone variation. In the South Hills, Idaho, where Tamiasciurus are absent and red crossbills are thought to be coevolving with lodgepole pine, crossbills experienced stabilizing selection on bill size, with cone structure as the agent of selection. These results show that crossbills and lodgepole pine exhibit reciprocal adaptations in response to reciprocal selection, and they provide insight into the traits mediating and responding to selection in a coevolutionary arms race.},

In this review, we examine how plant fruit traits (morphology, colour and display, nutritional quality, accessibility and phenology), avian traits (fruit handling techniques, gut passage time and effect, bird movements and social behaviour and dietary composition) and landscape structure (fruit neighbourhood, habitat loss and fragmentation and perch tree effects) affect frugivory and seed dispersal in invasive plants. This functional approach could be used to develop generic models of seed dispersal distributions for suites of invasive plant species and improve management efficiencies. Four broad research approaches are described that could direct management of bird-dispersed invasive plants at the landscape scale, by manipulating dispersal. First, research is needed to quantify the effect of biological control agents oil dispersal, particularly how changes in fruit production and/or quality affect fruit choice by frugivores, dispersal distributions of seed and post-dispersal processes. Second, we explore how seed dispersal could be directed, such as by manipulating perch structures and/or vegetation density to attract frugivorous birds after they have been foraging oil invasive plant fruits. Third, the major sources of seed spread could be identified and removed (i.e. targeting core or satellite infestations, particular habitats and creating barrier zones). Fourth, alternative food resources could be provided for frugivores, to replace fruits of invasive plants, and their use quantified.},

Water had no appreciable direct effect on morphological or chemical traits. Shaded seedlings grew less but had greater total leaf area. Simulated herbivory decreased the total leaf area, and root and aerial mass. Among the chemical characteristics, shaded seedlings had higher levels of nitrogen and lower levels of condensed tannins. In colorimetric assays of tannins, clipped seedlings had lower absorbances than did unclipped plants, and this effect was more pronounced in the sun than in the shade. Our experiment shows that light availability and herbivory affect the development and defence of Q. pyrenaica seedlings. Although Q. pyrenaica tolerated shade and simulated herbivory, both factors decreased biomass and chemical defence, which could affect the seedlings' future performance.},

abstract = {Different kinds of plant-animal interactions are ordinarily studied in isolation, yet considering the combined fitness effects of mutuallstic and antagonistic interactions is essential to understanding plant character evolution. Functional, structural, or phylogenetic associations between attractive and defensive traits may be non-adaptive or result from correlational selection on sets of herbivory-and pollination-linked traits. Nonadditivity of fitness effects of mutualists and antagonists, a requisite for correlational selection, was experimentally tested in the field. We created experimental populations of the insect-pollinated perennial herb, Helleborus foetidus, at 16 different locations distributed among three regions in the Iberian Peninsula. Plants experienced one of four possible selective regimes generated by independently weakening the effects of pollinators and herbivores (flower and fruit predators) according to a two-way fully factorial design. Effects were assessed in terms of number of next-generation offspring recruited per mother plant under natural field conditions. Differences among H. foetidus plants in the strength of their interactions with pollinators and herbivores translated into differential fitness, as measured in terms of recruited offspring, and subsequent changes in plant population densities. A strong, geographically consistent nonadditivity in the fitness consequences of pollinators and herbivores was found also. Plants possessing the particular combination of 'traits' simultaneously enhancing pollination and escape from herbivores enjoyed a disproportionate fitness advantage over plants possessing any of the other three possible 'trait' combinations. Results suggest a simple, possibly widespread ecological pathway favoring the adaptive correlated evolution of mutualism- and antagonism-related plant traits in pollinator-dependent plants suffering intense flower and fruit herbivory.},

abstract = {We present results of a three-year study on the frugivory, foraging behavior and factors influencing bird preference visits among conspecific fruiting shrubs of the 'Balo' (Plocama pendula), an endemic plant of low xerophytic zones in the Canary Islands. Only four bird species were recorded eating fruits of the 20 individual plants studied, including two seed disperser species, Sylvia melanocephala (frequency of visits, FV = 64.8{\%}) and Sylvia conspicillata (FV = 20.9{\%}), one seed predator (Serinus canarius, FV = 12.6{\%}), and one pulp consumer (Parus caeruleus, FV = 1.7{\%}). The number of visits/hour by the two warbler species (1.65) was significantly higher than that of the seed predator (0.28) in the three years. However, visitation rates by dispersers decreased from 1993 to 1995 while a higher visitation rate was observed in 1995 for seed predators. Foraging rates (number of fruits consumed/visit) of seed predators ((x) over bar = 19.2) was higher than for legitimate flbirds than for seed predators. Legitimate dispersers tended to select plants in well-developed shrub cover sites, with a low crop size of neighboring conspecifics and a high individual crop size. Visitation rate by the seed predator species to the plants was significantly correlated with fruit crop size and the presence of high numbers of seeds per fruit.},

abstract = {Adult acanthocephalan body sizes vary interspecifically over more than two orders of magnitude; yet, despite its importance for our understanding of the coevolutionary links between hosts and parasites, this variation remains unexplained. Here, we used a comparative analysis to investigate how final adult sizes and relative increments in size following establishment in the definitive host are influenced by three potential determinants of acanthocephalan sizes: initial (cystacanth) size at infection, host body mass, and the thermal regime experienced during growth, i.e. whether the definitive host is an ectotherm or an endotherm. Relative growth front the cystacanth stage to the adult stage ranged from twofold to more than 10,000-fold across acanthocephalan species, averaging just over 100-fold. However, this relative increment in size did not correlate with host mass, and did not differ between acanthocephalan species using ectothermic hosts and those growing in endothermic hosts. In contrast, final acanthocephalan adult sizes correlated positively with host mass, and after correction for host mass, final adult sizes were higher in species parasitising endotherms than in those found in ectotherms. The relationship between host mass and acanthocephalan adult size practically disappears, however, once phylogenetic influences are taken into account. Positive relationships between adult acanthocephalan size, cystacanth size and egg size indicate that a given relative size is a feature of an acanthocephalan species at all stages of its life cycle. These relationships also suggest that adult size is to some extent determined by cystacanth size, and that the characteristics of the definitive host are not the sole determinants of parasite life history traits.

Here, we use a simple model of community dynamics to predict how the functional consequences of random and non-random extinction may differ. The model suggests that when resource partitioning or facilitation structures communities, the functional consequences of non-random extinction depend on the covariance between species traits and cumulative extinction risks, and the compensatory responses among survivors. Strong competition increases the difference between random and ordered extinctions, but mutualisms reduce the difference. When diversity affects function via a sampling effect, the difference between random and ordered extinction depends on the covariance between species traits and the change in the probability of being the competitive dominant caused by ordered extinction. These findings show how random assembly experiments can be combined with information about species traits to make qualitative predictions about the functional consequences of various extinction scenarios.},

abstract = {An economy of scale may lead to selection to increase interannual variation in seed production when the per seed probability of seedling establishment. increases with seed production. Variable annual seedfall will, however, reduce this probability when post-dispersal seed fate is negatively density dependent on the local density of seeds, and seed dispersal and density dependence act identically across years. Intuitively, more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density-dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production.We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment, evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed-to-seedling transition, and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seedfall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5-m(2) seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1-m(2) seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species. The density of seedling recruits tended to increase with the density of seeds; however, the per seed probability of recruitment invariably decreased with seedfall density. Negative density dependence characterized the seed-to-seedling transition. Observed levels of spatial and interannual variation in seedfall density would reduce long-term recruitment by up to 28{\%} if negatively density-dependent survival acted identically across years; however, the strength of negative density dependence varied significantly among years for 12 of 32 species. Negative density dependence occurred in all years for these species but was significantly weaker during the one or two years of greatest seedfall than during the remaining years of lower seedfall. The per seed probability of recruitment increased significantly with annual seedfall for eight of these species. These eight species realized postdispersal economies of scale despite the reduction in long-term recruitment expected from the synergism between variable annual seed production and negatively density-dependent seed fate.},

abstract = {We studied variation in flowering phenology, fruit and seed set, and the abundance of the pollinators of four species of night-blooming Sonoran Desert columnar cacti for up to eight years at one site in Mexico and one year at one site in Arizona. We determined how spatiotemporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions affects the evolution of generalized pollination systems. We conducted pollinator exclusion and hand pollination experiments to document annual variability in pollinator reliability and to determine whether pollination systems were redundant (different species are partially or totally substitutable) or complementary (different species have an additive effect on fruit set). The cacti we studied included three species with generalized pollination systems involving bats, birds, and bees (cardon, Pachycereus pringlei; Saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea; and organ pipe, Stenocereus thurberi) and one specialized moth-pollinated species (senita, Lophocereus schottii). We predicted that the migratory lesser long-nosed bat, Leptonycteris curasoae, is a less reliable pollinator than birds and bees, and that cacti with generalized pollination systems have more variable flowering phenologies than the specialized species. Annual time of peak flowering and mean size of flower crops were relatively invariant in Saguaro and organ pipe. Time of peak flowering in cardon varied by as much as six weeks, and mean flower crop size varied threefold over six years. In senita, peak flowering varied by as much as 5-8 wk among years. Peak numbers of the nectar bat L. curasoae varied among years, and bat density (0.9/ha) was an order of magnitude lower than that of cactus-visiting birds at both study sites. The abundance of migratory hummingbirds was also highly variable among years. Pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that bats were major pollinators of cardon, whereas diurnal visitors accounted for most fruit set in Saguaro (except in 1995 when bats were most important) and organ pipe at our Mexican site; honeybees accounted for 64-87{\%} of diurnal fruit set in these species. Annual variation in the contribution to fruit set by bats was substantially higher than that of diurnal pollinators in Saguaro and organ pipe, but not in cardon. There was little geographic variation in the relative importance of nocturnal vs. diurnal pollinators in Saguaro and senita, but bats were much more important for fruit set in organ pipe in Arizona than in Mexico. We generally detected no effect of different pollinators on number of seeds per fruit in any species. Annual variation in fruit set was lowest in saguaro, the species with the most diurnal pollination system, and highest in organ pipe, the species with the most generalized pollination system. Fruit set was strongly pollen limited only in females of cardon (a trioecious species) and in organ pipe (at both sites). The "missing" pollinators in both species are likely Leptonycteris bats. The pollination systems of saguaro and cardon were partially redundant, whereas that of organ pipe was complementary. The four species of cactus that we studied occur at the northern geographic limits of Mexican columnar cacti where many vertebrate pollinators are seasonal migrants. In the Sonoran Desert, variation in rainfall and spring temperatures affects timing of flowering and the extent of competition between cacti for pollinator visits and causes the relative importance of particular pollinators, especially Leptonyeteris bats, for fruit set to vary annually. Under such conditions, selection has favored generalized pollination systems (as seen in organ pipe) or shifts from reliance primarily on nocturnal pollinators (as seen in cardon) to reliance primarily on diurnal pollinators (as seen in Saguaro). Nonetheless, as exemplified by the senita-senita moth system, highly specialized pollination mutualisms can also evolve in this habitat in plants that rely on sedentary insects rather than migratory bats and birds for pollination. },

abstract = {Epidemiological models generally explore the evolution of parasite life-history traits, namely, virulence and transmission, against a background of constant host life- history traits. However, life-history models have predicted the evolution of host traits in response to parasitism. The coevolution of host and parasite life-history traits remains largely unexplored. We present an epidemiological model, based on resource allocation theory, that provides an analysis of the coevolution between host reproductive effort and parasite virulence. This model allows for hosts with either a fixed (i.e., genetic) or conditional (i.e., a phenotypically plastic) response to parasitism. It also considers superinfections. We show that parasitism always favors increased allocation to host reproduction, but because of epidemiological feedbacks, the evolutionarily stable host reproductive effort does not always increase with parasite virulence. Superinfection drives the evolution of parasite virulence and acts on the evolution of the host through parasite evolution, generally leading to higher host reproductive effort. Coevolution, as opposed to cases where only one of the antagonists evolves, may generate correlations between host and parasite life-history traits across environmental gradients affecting the fecundity or the survival of the host. Our results provide a theoretical framework against which experimental coevolution outcomes or field observations can be contrasted.},

We predicted that gut passage and removal away from mother plants would enhance the quantity, speed, and asynchrony of seed germination. Results showed that percent germination was altered by gut passage, but that the magnitude and even the direction of such effects varied according to plant and disperser species. Likewise, dispersal away from mother plants affected the percentage and germination speed in some species but not others. Gut passage increased asynchrony of germination in Rubus and Pyrus, and removal from the mother plant increased asynchrony in Rubus, which likely enhances plant fitness in unpredictable environments. Gut passage generally had a stronger effect on germination than removal away from mother plants, but for some species both factors were similarly influential. Therefore, the combined effects of both seed dispersal services varied individually among fruit and frugivore species, leading to unusually high functional diversity in this seed dispersal mutualism.},

Classic examples include the interactions between phytophagous insects and their host plants, thick-shelled invertebrates and their shell-crushing predators, and ungulates and their predators. There are three major hypotheses for the nonequilibrium coevolutionary dynamics of these multispecific trophic interactions: escalation in traits, cycles in traits leading to fluctuating polymorphisms, and coevolutionary alternation. The conditions under which cycles and escalation are likely to occur have been well developed theoretically. In contrast, the conditions favoring coevolutionary alternation-evolutionary fluctuations in predator or prey preference driven by evolutionary shifts in relative levels of prey defense and vice versa-have yet to be identified. Using a set of quantitative coevolutionary models, we demonstrate that coevolutionary alternation can occur across a wide range of biologically plausible conditions. The result is often repeated, and potentially rapid, evolutionary shifts in patterns of specialization within networks of interacting species.},

abstract = {Many mutualistic interactions are probably not mutualistic across all populations and years. This article explores consequences of this observation with a series of genetic models that consider how variable mutualisms coevolve. The first models, previously introduced in a general coevolutionary context, consider two coevolving species whose fitness interactions change between beneficial and antagonistic in response to independent spatial or temporal variation in the abiotic or biotic environment. The results demonstrate that both temporal and spatial variability in fitness interactions can cause partner species with tightly matched traits favored by unconditional mutualisms to be vulnerable to evolutionary invasion by alternative types. A new model presented here shows that an additional mutualistic species can have a similar effect and can even cause fitness interactions between the other two species to evolve. Under some conditions, the pairwise interactions can change unidirectionally from mutualistic to antagonistic, with virtually no evolutionary change in either partner species. In other cases, fitness interactions between the species pair can oscillate between mutualism and antagonism as a result of coevolution in the third species. Taken as a whole, these theoretical results suggest that many features of mutualistic coevolution can best be understood by considering spatial, temporal, and community-dependent patterns of fitness interactions.},

We describe seedling distribution patterns from a complete census of all seedlings of these 14 taxa present in 36 treefall gaps.2 A maximum likelihood model, incorporating both distance to adult trees and tree size, fitted observed seed rain to traps quite well for all taxa.3 The ability to predict seedling recruit number per gap varied greatly among taxa. For 8 of 14 taxa, regression models incorporating predicted seed rain were significantly better predictors of seedling recruitment than models in which recruitment probability was assumed constant in all sites.4 To see if variation in local dispersal patterns determined the community composition of gaps, we examined the relative abundances of these 14 pioneer taxa in the 36 gaps. We found that taxon abundances were significantly positively correlated with abundances predicted from seed dispersal models and seed-seedling regressions for 27 out of 36 gaps.5 Overall, we find evidence that limited seed dispersal is an important factor contributing, together with factors affecting post-dispersal recruitment success, to seedling distribution patterns in gaps.},

These resources are designed to complement the existing poplar genome sequence and poplar (Populus spp.) ESTs by focusing on herbivore- and elicitor-treated tissues and incorporating normalization methods to capture rare transcripts. From a set of 15 standard, normalized or full-length cDNA libraries, we generated 139 007 3'- or 5'-end sequenced ESTs, representing more than one-third of the c. 385 000 publicly available Populus ESTs. Clustering and assembly of 107 519 3'-end ESTs resulted in 14 451 contigs and 20 560 singletons, altogether representing 35 011 putative unique transcripts, or potentially more than three-quarters of the predicted c. 45 000 genes in the poplar genome. Using this EST resource, we developed a cDNA microarray containing 15 496 unique genes, which was utilized to monitor gene expression in poplar leaves in response to herbivory by forest tent caterpillars (Malacosoma disstria). After 24 h of feeding, 1191 genes were classified as up-regulated, compared to only 537 down-regulated. Functional classification of this induced gene set revealed genes with roles in plant defence (e.g. endochitinases, Kunitz protease inhibitors), octadecanoid and ethylene signalling (e.g. lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase), transport (e.g. ABC proteins, calreticulin), secondary metabolism [e.g. polyphenol oxidase, isoflavone reductase, (-)-germacrene D synthase] and transcriptional regulation [e.g. leucine-rich repeat transmembrane kinase, several transcription factor classes (zinc finger C3H type, AP2/EREBP, WRKY, bHLH)].

Whether from long-term interactions of many factors affecting birth, death, and establishment within natural communities or from short-term interactions of recently created communities species abundance distributions are roughly lognormal or even more attenuated. The greater the predisturbance species diversity of remnants or the planting diversity of restorations, and the smaller the area of a habitat patch, the more likely a large proportion of species will exist in populations so small that they are acutely or chronically vulnerable to local extinction. We suggest that habitat fragmentation will inevitably favor plants and animals that are highly mobile, early successional species, including many exotic weeds among plants, or,species that are historically organized as metapopulations that happen to be common enough to function as such. We further explore rationales for countering the effects of Inherent rarity, including connectivity from buffers, corridors, and stepping stones, and dominance suppression from seasonally appropriate mowing, grating or fire.},

The seventh year after sowing, plants still persisted and were reproducing in several plots, demonstrating that the species is dispersal-limited. However, long-term survival of transplants was higher at sites where Dentaria occurred naturally, and this difference increased with time after sowing. Thus, the importance of local factors may only be expressed fully several years after colonisation. Differences in soil chemistry and disturbance treatment were not associated with differences in patch suitability. Removal of molluscs, however, significantly increased recruitment, and the effects of a single molluscicide treatment persisted after four years. We conclude that dispersal is not the only limitation to the distribution of Dentaria, and that local factors, such as mollusc herbivory, are also crucial.},

In this study, I examined the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in setting the local range limits of Mazzaella parksii (formerly Mazzaella cornucopiae). In Washington State, this turf-forming red alga occurs almost exclusively in a discrete high intertidal band on north-facing, wave-exposed shores. I investigated the mechanisms underlying these distributional patterns via a series of intra- and extra- limital transplant experiments coupled with manipulations of interacting species and abiotic stress. The upper limit of Mazzaella was set by physiological stress; turfs,transplanted above the natural Mazzaella zone bleached and died over the course of a few months. Mazzaella's lower limit was set by herbivory; turfs transplanted below the natural zone were consumed in treatments accessible to grazers but thrived in herbivore-exclusion plots. South-facing transplants at the same intertidal height as the natural north-facing Mazzaella zone declined regardless of interspecific interactions, indicating that Mazzaella's upper limit is lower on south-facing shores. However, the position of the herbivore-determined lower limit was similar between aspects. South-facing transplants could survive below the natural Mazzaella zone if the grazer- determined lower limit was extended downshore by herbivore exclusions or at Mazzaella's natural intertidal height (i.e.; the height at which it persists on north-facing surfaces) if the physiologically determined upper limit was extended upshore by experimental shades. In the absence of such experimental modifications, Mazzaella was effectively excluded from south- facing shores because its upper limit had converged on its lower limit. Thus, abiotic factors and biological factors interact to set the horizontal distributional limits of this alga. This conceptual model is consistent with Ma7zaella's distribution at a variety of spatial scales and has broad implications for both spatial patterns and temporal trends in the distribution and abundance of species.},

abstract = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability [1-6]. However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7-9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.},

abstract = {In the unique fauna assemblage of the Malagasy rain forest, lemurs appear to play particularly important roles as seed-dispersing frugivores. A three-month study of feeding ecology and seed dispersal by four species of lemurs in Madagascar's eastern rain forest found that three species, Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus, and Varecia variegata were seed dispersers, and the fourth, Propithecus diadema, was a seed predator. In germination trials, seeds passed by lemurs sprouted significantly faster and in greater numbers than those not passed by lemurs. Analysis of fruit morphologies of 69 local plant taxa producing fleshy fruits during the study period found that these fruits fell into two well-defined color categories that correlated significantly with fruit size. Seventy seven percent of fleshy fruits greater than 10 mm in diameter were colored green, brown, tan, purplish, or black, while all fruits less than 10 mm in diameter were colored red, yellow, orange, pink, blue, or white. Three introduced exotic plant species provided exceptions to this pattern, producing fruits which were larger than 10 mm and pink or orange. Fruits chosen by the primates in this study were usually larger than 10 mm in diameter and were in nearly all cases colored green, brown, tan, purplish, red, or some combination of these colors. Morphological traits shared by fruits of multiple plant taxa in the diets of seed-dispersing lemurs suggest possible coevolved relationships between Malagasy rain forest plants and lemurs.},

abstract = {Aim In this study we tested the hypothesis that the dispersal success (estimated here as fruit removal rate) of a native shrub species living in the Balearic Archipelago, Cneorum tricoccon L. (Cneoraceae), has decreased significantly in those islands where endemic lizards of the genus Podarcis have disappeared. These lizards acted as the main seed dispersers of the plant and became extinct after the introduction of carnivores. At least one of these carnivores, the pine marten (Martes martes L.), is also an important frugivore, consuming the fruits and dispersing the seeds of C. tricoccon and thus allowing the comparison of fruit removal rates between the two groups of vertebrates (lizards and mammals). We further tested the possibility that lizards (in particular, P. pityusensis Bosca) could be exerting selection on seed size.Methods In seven populations from four islands, we monitored fruit removal by either lizards or mammals. The fruits of C. tricoccon do not drop after ripening, remaining attached to the branches for long periods if not removed. In order to test whether lizards might be exerting selection on seed size, we compared seed diameter and weight between defecated and uningested (collected directly from plants) seeds for each of the populations.Results Fruits were removed in significantly greater proportions in those populations where lizards are still present. Data showed that in two of the examined populations in the Pityusic islands, defecated seeds were lighter and smaller than controls suggesting that lizards selected fruits of smaller size than the average of the population.Main conclusions The introduction of carnivores in the Balearics has led to important changes in the population dynamics of many native species. In the larger islands (Mallorca and Menorca), carnivores seemed to have caused the extinction of endemic lizards who acted as the only dispersers of some plants such as C. tricoccon. Pine martens, in particular, are in turn frugivorous and thus can 'replace' to some extent the 'lost' seed dispersers. We hypothesize that besides having decreased fruit removal rates in this shrub, these 'new' dispersers have modified considerably the distribution of the plant on Mallorca island, as the fossil record shows that lizards lived at low altitudes ({\textless}500 m a.s.l.) and the plant can be currently found up to 1000 m a.s.l. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that lizards might be exerting a selective pressure on seed size. If this is true, this pressure might have been released - or counteracted if carnivores select for fruit size as well - after the extinction of lizards from some islands, which would have important ecological consequences for the plant.},

abstract = {Coevolution is one of the major processes organizing the earth's biodiversity. The need to understand coevolution as an ongoing process has grown as ecological concerns have risen over the dynamics of rapidly changing biological communities, the conservation of genetic diversity, and the population biology of diseases. The biggest current challenge is to understand how coevolution operates across broad geographic landscapes, linking local ecological processes with phylogeographic patterns. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution provides a framework for asking how coevolution continually reshapes interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. It produces specific hypotheses on how geographically structured coevolution differs from coevolution at the local scale. It also provides a framework for understanding how local maladaptation can result from coevolution and why coevolved interactions may rarely produce long lists of coevolved traits that become fixed within species. Long-term field studies of the same interaction across multiple communities and spatially structured mathematical models are together beginning to show that coevolution may be a more important ongoing process than had been indicated by earlier empirical and theoretical studies lacking a geographic perspective.},

Lipid-rich fruits were selected by the bird species with slower food passage rates through the digestive tract. These bird species also fed frequently on insects and seeds. Bird species with faster food passage rates fed less on insects and seeds, and ate mainly fruits with pulp poor in lipids (rich in sugars and water). Studies of digestion in birds indicate that lipids require slower food passage rates for efficient digestion and intestinal transport than simple sugars. The available evidence indicates that the European bird species that show stronger preferences for lipid-rich fruits are no better as seed dispersers, from the point of view of the plants, than species choosing lipid-poor fruits. Thus, the degree of frugivory of birds, their fruit choice patterns and their effects on seed dispersal do not seem to be related to each other in the ways expected by the early models of the evolution of fleshy fruits.},

abstract = {The services provided within a community can change as the species composition of that community changes. For example, ant-seed dispersal mutualisms can be disrupted in habitats dominated by invasive ants. We propose that this disruption is related to changes in mean ant body size, given that invasive ants are smaller than most native seed-dispersing ants. We demonstrate that the mean and maximum distances that ants transport seeds adapted for ant dispersal increase with worker body size, and that this relationship is an accelerating power function. This pattern is consistent among three ant subfamilies that include most seed-dispersing ants as well as most invasive ant species, is generalizable across ant species and communities, and is independent of diaspore mass. Using a case study, we demonstrate that both the mean body size of seed-collecting ants and seed dispersal distances are decreased in sites invaded by Solenopsis invicta, the imported red fire ant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mean size of seed-collecting ants at a seed depot or within a community is a useful predictor of mean seed dispersal distances at those sites. Last, we show that small seed-collecting ants and decreased seed dispersal distances are common features of sites occupied by invasive ants. The link between ant body size and seed dispersal distance, combined with the dominance of invaded communities by typically small ants, predicts the disruption of native ant-seed dispersal mutualisms in invaded habitats.},

abstract = {A variety of nut-producing plants have mutualistic seed-dispersal interactions with animals (rodents and corvids) that scatter hoard their nuts in the soil. The goals of this review are to summarize the widespread horticultural, botanical, and ecological literature pertaining to nut dispersal in Juglans, Carya, Quercus, Fagus, Castanae, Castanopsis, Lithocarpus, Corylus, Aesculus, and Prunus; to examine the evolutionary histories of these mutualistic interactions; and to identify the traits of nut-bearing plants and nut-dispersing rodents and jays that influence the success of the mutualism. These interactions appear to have originated as early as the Paleocene, about 60 million years ago. Most nuts appear to have evolved from ancestors with wind-dispersed seeds, but the ancestral form of dispersal in almonds (Prunus spp.) was by frugivorous animals that ingested fruit. Nut-producing species have evolved a number of traits that facilitate nut dispersal by certain rodents and corvids while serving to exclude other animals that act as parasites of the mutualism. Nuts are nutritious food sources, often with high levels of lipids or proteins and a caloric value ranging from 5.7 to 153.5 kJ per propagule, 10-1000 times greater than most wind-dispersed seeds. These traits make nuts highly attractive food items for dispersers and nut predators. The course of nut development tends to reduce losses of nuts to insects, microbes, and nondispersing animals, but despite these measures predispersal and postdispersal nut mortality is generally high. Chemical defenses (e.g., tannins) in the cotyledons or the husk surrounding the nut discourage some nut predators. Masting of nuts (periodic, synchronous production of large nut crops) appears to reduce losses to insects and to increase the number of nuts dispersed by animals, and it may increase cross-pollination. Scatter hoarding by rodents and corvids removes nuts from other sources of nut predation, moves nuts away from source trees where density-dependent mortality is high (sometimes to habitats or microhabitats that favor seedling establishment), and buries nuts in the soil (which reduces rates of predation and helps to maintain nut viability). The large nutrient reserves of nuts not only attract animal dispersers but also permit seedlings to establish a large photosynthetic surface or extensive root system, making them especially competitive in low-light environments (e.g., deciduous forest) and semi-arid environments (e.g., dry mountains, Mediterranean climates). The most important postestablishment causes of seedling failure are drought, insufficient light, browsing by vertebrate herbivores, and competition with forbs and grasses. Because of the nutritional qualities of nuts and the synchronous production of large nut crops by a species throughout a region, nut trees can have pervasive impacts on other members of ecological communities. Nut-bearing trees have undergone dramatic changes in distribution during the last 16,000 years, following the glacial retreat from northern North America and Europe, and the current dispersers of nuts (i.e., squirrels, jays, and their relatives) appear to have been responsible for these movements.},

We study possible evolutionary mechanisms for this observation using a simple model that couples coevolution and demography. The model assumes that the environment consists of two habitats connected by movement and that coevolution is governed by quantitative traits. Our results demonstrate that host gene flow is an important determinant of parasite geographic range. Fluctuations in the rate of host gene flow cause shifts in parasite population densities and associated range expansions or contractions. In extreme cases, changing the rate of host gene flow can lead to global extinction of the parasite. Through a process we term demographic compensation, these shifts in parasite density may occur with little or no change in parasite adaptation to the host. As a consequence, reciprocal adaptation between host and parasite can become uncoupled from the rate of host gene flow.},

abstract = {Some species of animals provide directed dispersal of plant seeds by transporting them nonrandomly to microsites where their chances of producing healthy seedlings are enhanced. We investigated whether this mutualistic interaction occurs between granivorous rodents and Jeffrey pine ( Pinus jeffreyi) in the eastern Sierra Nevada by comparing the effectiveness of random abiotic seed dispersal with the dispersal performed by four species of rodents: deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus), yellow-pine and long-eared chipmunks ( Tamias amoenus and T. quadrimaculatus), and golden-mantled ground squirrels ( Spermophilus lateralis). We conducted two caching studies using radio-labeled seeds, the. first with individual animals in. field enclosures and the second with a community of rodents in open forest. We used artificial caches to compare the fates of seeds placed at the range of microsites and depths used by animals with the fates of seeds dispersed abiotically. Finally, we examined the distribution and survival of naturally establishing seedlings over an eight-year period.Several lines of evidence suggested that this community of rodents provided directed dispersal. Animals preferred to cache seeds in microsites that were favorable for emergence or survival of seedlings and avoided caching in microsites in which seedlings fared worst. Seeds buried at depths typical of animal caches (5-25 mm) produced at least. five times more seedlings than did seeds on the forest. floor. The four species of rodents differed in the quality of dispersal they provided. Small, shallow caches made by deer mice most resembled seeds dispersed by abiotic processes, whereas many of the large caches made by ground squirrels were buried too deeply for successful emergence of seedlings. Chipmunks made the greatest number of caches within the range of depths and microsites favorable for establishment of pine seedlings. Directed dispersal is an important element of the population dynamics of Jeffrey pine, a dominant tree species in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Quantifying the occurrence and dynamics of directed dispersal in this and other cases will contribute to better understanding of mutualistic coevolution of plants and animals and to more effective management of ecosystems in which directed dispersal is a keystone process.},

We studied the potential effect of outcrossing in a tapeworm, Schistocephalus solidus, on both infection success and growth in its first intermediate host, the copepod Macrocyclops albidus. Tapeworms that had been obtained from natural populations of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were allowed to reproduce either alone or in pairs, in an in vitro system that replaced the final host's gut. This resulted in either selfed or outcrossed offspring, respectively. In one part of the experiment, copepods were exposed to either selfed or outcrossed parasites, in a second part to both types simultaneously, in order to study the effect of competition between them. To discriminate parasites of either origin within the same host, a novel method for fluorescent vital labeling was used. We show here for the first time that outcrossed parasites had a higher infection success and faster development in the host. This advantage of outcrossing became apparent only in the competitive situation, in which superior abilities of parasites to extract limiting resources from the host become crucial.; },

abstract = {Evidence concerning mechanisms hypothesized to explain species coexistence in hyper-diverse communities is reviewed for tropical forest plants. Three hypotheses receive strong support. Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary interactions depend upon a phenotypic interface of traits in each species that mediate the outcome of interactions among individuals. These phenotypic interfaces usually involve performance traits, such as locomotion or resistance to toxins, that comprise an integrated suite of physiological, morphological and behavioral traits. The reciprocal selection from species interactions may act directly on performance, but it is ultimately the evolution of these underlying components that shape the patterns of coevolutionary adaptation in performance. Bridging the macroevolutionary patterns of coevolution to the ecological processes that build them therefore requires a way to dissect the phenotypic interface of coevolution and determine how specific components of performance in one species exert selection on complimentary components of performance in a second species. We present an approach for analyzing the strength of selection in a coevolutionary interaction where individuals interact at random, and for identifying which component traits of the phenotypic interface are critical to mediating coevolution. The approach is illustrated with data from a predator-prey arms race between garter snakes and newts that operates through the interface of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and resistance to it.},

abstract = {The Enemies Hypothesis predicts that alien plants have a competitive advantage over native plants because they are often introduced with few herbivores or diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, we transplanted seedlings of the invasive alien tree, Sapitan sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) and an ecologically similar native tree, Celtis laevigata (hackberry), into mesic forest, floodplain forest, and coastal prairie sites in east Texas and manipulated foliar fungal diseases and insect herbivores with fungicidal and insecticidal sprays. As predicted by the Enemies Hypothesis, insect herbivores caused significantly greater damage to untreated Celtis seedlings than to untreated Sapium seedlings. However, contrary to predictions, suppression of insect herbivores caused significantly greater increases in survivorship and growth of Sapium seedlings compared to Celtis seedlings. Regressions suggested that Sapium seedlings compensate for damage in the first year but that this greatly increases the risk of mortality in subsequent years. Fungal diseases had no effects on seedling survival or growth. The Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis predicts that the local abundance of a species will depend more on local seed input than on competitive ability at that location. To investigate this hypothesis, we added seeds of Celtis and Sapitan on and off of artificial soil disturbances at all three sites. Adding seeds increased the density of Celtis seedlings and sometimes Sapitan seedlings, with soil disturbance only affecting density of Celtis. Together the results of these experiments suggest that the success of Sapium may depend on high rates of seed input into these ecosystems and high growth potential. as well as performance advantages of seedlings caused by low rates of herbivory.},

Because of the unique morphology of the syconium, it has been difficult to investigate the evolutionary position of the fig. We sequenced the chloroplast gene ndhF to examine relationships in Moraceae and to elucidate shifts in reproductive traits. The reclassification of tribes is warranted, and the limits of Artocarpeae, Moreae, and Castilleae are revised to reflect evolutionary relationships. The results point to ancestral dioecy in Moraceae and multiple origins of monoecy, androdioecy, and gynodioecy. Ancestral wind pollination gave way to insect pollination at least twice. Strong support for the sister-group relationship of a revised Castilleae with Ficus suggests that entomophily and involucral bracts encircling the flowers preceded the evolution of the syconium. Bracts surround flowers in Castilleae only during early development, but in Ficus the involucre and the receptacle enclose the fruit as well. Molecular dating suggests that fig pollination is at least 80-90 million years old. The diversity of Ficus relative to its sister group is a likely consequence of ancient specialization and cospeciation with pollinating fig wasps.},

We evaluated whether local temporal dynamics of ecological outcome in the interaction between the moth Greya politella (Prodoxidae) and its host plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) are likely to mitigate or magnify geographic differences in ecological outcome found in earlier studies. The moths are highly host-specific pollinating floral parasites, and the mutualism can be swamped in some populations by the presence of effective co-pollinators. Hence, differing community contexts can shift the outcome of the interaction from mutualism to commensalism or antagonism. During each of four years, we evaluated the effect of Greya oviposition on seed development through a paired design that controlled for plant genotype and microenvironment. At Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge in Washington State, the interaction was significantly mutualistic in all four years. Mutualism in this population was indicated by a higher probability of development of capsules visited by ovipositing Greya than capsules not visited by Greya on the same plant. At Rapid River, Idaho, the interaction was commensalistic in three years and antagonistic in one year. Antagonism in this population was indicated by selective withering of capsules containing Greya eggs. Overall, the results suggest stable geographic differences in the range of ecological outcomes in this plant-insect interaction under different community contexts.},

abstract = {The leaves of extant terrestrial plants show highly diverse and elaborate patterns of leaf venation. One fundamental feature of many leaf venation patterns, especially in the case of angiosperm leaves, is the presence of anastomoses. Anastomosing Veins distinguish a network topologically from a simple dendritic (tree-like) pattern which represents the primitive venation architecture. The high degree of interspecific variation of entire venation patterns as well as phenotypic plasticity of some venation properties, such as venation density, indicate the high selective pressure acting on this branching system. Few investigations deal with functional properties of the leaf venation system. The interrelationships between topological or geometric properties of the various leaf venation patterns and functional aspects are far from being well understood. In this review we summarize current knowledge of interrelationships between the form and function of leaf venation and the evolution of leaf venation patterns. Since the functional aspects of architectural features of different leaf venation patterns are considered, the review also refers to the topic of individual and intraspecific variation. One basic function of leaf venation is represented by its contribution to the mechanical behaviour of a leaf. Venation geometry and density influences mechanical stability and may affect, for example, susceptibility to herbivory. Transport of water and carbohydrates is the other basic function of this system and the transport properties are also influenced by the venation architecture. These various functional aspects can be interpreted in an ecophysiological context. (C) 2001 Annals of Botany Company.},

abstract = {The complex mutualism between yuccas and the moths that pollinate their flowers is regarded as one of the most obvious cases of coevolution. Studies of related genera show that at least two of the critical behavioral and life history traits suggested to have resulted from coevolved mutualism in yucca moths are plesiomorphic to the family. Another trait, oviposition into flowers, has evolved repeatedly within the family. One species with these traits, Greya politella, feeds on and pollinates plants of a different family, but pollination occurs through a different component of the oviposition behavior than in the yucca moths. Major differences compared with yucca moths and their hosts are that G. politella only passively pollinates its host and that copollinators often contribute to pollination. This analysis suggests that evolution of mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths may have required few behavioral and life history changes in the moths. The truly coevolved features of this interaction appear to be the evolution of active pollination by the moths, the associated morphological structures in the moths for carrying pollen, and the exclusion of copollinators by yuccas.},

Because more seeds and seedlings are killed under and near fruiting trees than 15-45 m away, seed dispersal confers a 20-40 fold advantage on seeds carried 45 m from fruiting adults. In contrast, {\textgreater} 60{\%} of seed and seedling death during the first year is due to seed predation by mammals, with {\textgreater} 90{\%} due to mammals among the {\textless} 2{\%} seeds that survive until maternal endosperm is exhausted +/- 12 weeks after seed fall. Mortaliy due to mammals is independent of distance from parent trees, confering no advantage to seed dispersal.

However, determination of the extent of 'herbivory' among ants may be crucial to understand the hyper-dominance of ants in tropical tree crowns, where prey organisms tend to occur scarcely and unpredictably. We therefore examined N and C stable isotope ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C) in 50 ant species and associated insects and plants from a tropical rainforest in North Queensland, Australia. Variation between ant species was pronounced (range of species means: 7.1parts per thousand in delta(15)N and 6.8parts per thousand in delta(13)C). Isotope signatures of the entire ant community overlapped with those of several herbivorous as well as predacious arthropods. Variability in delta(15)N between ants was not correlated with plant delta(15)N from which they were collected. Ant species spread out in a continuum between largely herbivorous and purely predacious taxa, with a high degree of omnivory. Ant species' delta(15)N were consistent with the trophic level predicted by natural feeding observations, but not their delta(13)C. Low delta(15)N levels were recorded for ant species that commonly forage for nectar on understorey or canopy plants, intermediate levels for species with large colonies that were highly abundant on nectar and honeydew sources and were predacious, and the highest levels for predominantly predatory ground-foraging species. Colonies of the dominant weaver-ants ( Oecophylla smaragdina) had significantly lower delta(15)N in mature forests (where preferred honeydew and nectar sources are abundant) than in open secondary vegetation. N concentration of ant dry mass showed only very limited variability across species and no correlation with trophic levels. This study demonstrates that stable isotopes provide a powerful tool for quantitative analyses of trophic niche partitioning and plasticity in complex and diverse tropical omnivore communities.},

abstract = {Animal foraging has been characterized as an attempt to maximize the intake of carbon and nitrogen at appropriate ratios. Plant species in over 90 families produce carbohydrate-rich extra. oral nectar (EFN), a resource attractive to ants and other omnivorous insects. This attraction can benefit the plant if those arthropods subsequently attack herbivores. This protective response has been attributed to the increased visitation and "ownership" of plants that provide a predictable source of fuel. Here, we propose and test an alternative (but non-mutually exclusive) hypothesis, that access to C-rich carbohydrates increases the ants' desire for N-rich protein and hence the likelihood that they will attack herbivorous insects on the host plant. This "deficit hypothesis" would be rejected if (1) EFN were itself a sufficiently balanced food source in terms of C and N, (2) ant dietary preferences were similar in the presence vs. absence of EFN, (3) protein-hungry ants were not more predaceous, or (4) ants provided access to protein were more aggressive toward potential prey items than were ants provided access to carbohydrates. We test these predictions in a protective mutualism between a guild of desert ants and the barrel cactus Ferocactus wislizeni. C: N ratios of EFN exceeded that of ants or potential prey items by an order of magnitude (i.e., EFN is an N-poor food for ants). Baiting studies demonstrated that plant-tending ant species recruited more workers to N-rich protein baits than to C-rich sugar baits; this difference was more pronounced when the ants had access to F. wislizeni EFN. From these data, we infer that protein is a valuable resource and that its relative value increases when carbohydrates are readily available. Moreover, ant colonies provided access to supplemental carbohydrates responded more aggressively to surrogate herbivores than did control colonies (to which no additional resources were provided) or colonies provided protein. These results support the predictions of the "deficit" hypothesis, wherein plant protection is elicited by plant-mediated dietary imbalances.},

Only 51 legume species (37.0{\%}) harboured bruchids (12 Bruchus spp. and 15 Bruchidius spp). Bruchids occurred in 38.3{\%}, of the host plant samples. Thirty-seven plant species congeneric with bruchid host species were unoccupied by bruchids.The degree of host specificity ranged from monophagy (at least ecological monophagy) to oligophagy. On the basis of presence/absence data we tested the null hypothesis assuming that plant taxa and seed consuming bruchid species form congruent phyletic relations Lit the species level. We argue that the case for coevolution between the beetles and their hosts is weak. A comparison of the available taxonomic relationships (and presumed phylogenies) best fits a case of sequential evolution. with stronger phylogenetic conservatism in Bruchus species than in Bruchidius species. Bruchid and host plant taxa showed rough congruence only at the tribe level. We suggest that host shifts are best explained by the changes in the bruchids chemosensory system that determines the females' host selection behaviour.},

abstract = {Recent ecological research has revealed that the Sonoran Desert columnar cactus Lophocereus and the pyralid moth Upiga virescens form in obligate pollination mutualism, a rare but important case of coevolution. To investigate the phylogenetic origins of this unusual pollination system, we used molecular sequence data to reconstruct the phylogeny of the four taxa within the genus Lophocereus and to determine the phylogenetic position of Lophocereus within the North American columnar cacti (tribe Pachycereeae). Our analysis included Lophocereus, six Pachycereus species, Carnegiea gigantea, and Neobuxbaumia tetetzo within the subtribe Pachycereinae, and Stenocereus thurberi as an outgroup within the Stenocereinae. Extensive screening of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes failed to reveal sequence variation within Lophocereus. At a deeper phylogenetic level, however, we found strong support for the placement of Lophocercus within Pachycereus as sister group to the hummingbird-pollinated P. marginatus. we discuss possible hypotheses that may explain the transition from but pollination (ancestral) to moth and hummingbird pollination in Lophocereus and P. marginatus, respectively. Additional phylogenetic analyses suggest that the genus Pachycereus should be expanded to include Lophocercus, Carnegiea, Neobuxbaumia, and perhaps other species, whereas P. hollianus may need to be excluded from this clade. Future Study will be needed to test taxonomic distinctions within Lophocereus, to test for parallel cladogenesis between phylogroups within Lophocereus and Upiga, and to fully delineate the genus Pachycereus and relationships among genera in the Pachycereinae. },

abstract = {This paper considers key issues in plant invasion ecology, where findings published since 1990 have significantly improved our understanding of many aspects of invasions. The review focuses on vascular plants invading natural and semi-natural ecosystems, and on fundamental ecological issues relating to species invasiveness and community invasibility. Three big questions addressed by the SCOPE programme in the 1980s (which species invade; which habitats are invaded; and how can we manage invasions?) still underpin most work in invasion ecology. Some organizing and unifying themes in the field are organism-focused and relate to species invasiveness (the tens rule; the concept of residence time; taxonomic patterns and Darwin's naturalization hypothesis; issues of phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolutionary change, including evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis; the role of long-distance dispersal). Others are ecosystem-centred and deal with determinants of the invasibility of communities, habitats and regions (levels of invasion, invasibility and propagule pressure; the biotic resistance hypothesis and the links between diversity and invasibility; synergisms, mutualisms, and invasional meltdown). Some theories have taken an overarching approach to plant invasions by integrating the concepts of species invasiveness and community invasibility (a theory of seed plant invasiveness; fluctuating resources theory of invasibility). Concepts, hypotheses and theories reviewed here can be linked to the naturalization-invasion continuum concept, which relates invasion processes with a sequence of environmental and biotic barriers that an introduced species must negotiate to become casual, naturalized and invasive. New research tools and improved research links between invasion ecology and succession ecology, community ecology, conservation biology and weed science, respectively, have strengthened the conceptual pillars of invasion ecology.},

abstract = {Two species of columnar cacti, Subpilocereus repandus and Stenocereus griseus, are pollinated on Curacao by two species of glossophagine bats, Leptonycteris curasoae and Glossophaga longirostris (Phyllostomidae). The pollination effectiveness of the two bat species can influence the evolution of this mutualism as well as the immediate availability of resources to frugivores and omnivores. I examined the effectiveness of single-visits by L, curasoae and G. longirostris on fruit-set, seed number, and fruit size for each cactus species.Single visits of L. curasoae produced higher fruit-set and seed number in Subpilocereus repandus than did single visits of G, longirostris, but the differences were not statistically significant, possibly as a result of the small size of the L, curasoae sample. The reverse trends were observed for Stenocereus griseus, Pollination of Subpilocereus repandus by L, curasoae resulted in significantly longer fruits than did pollination by G. longirostris, During the peak of the flowering season, flowers received many visits per night. Fruit size (length, width, total mass, pulp mass) was positively correlated with the number of seeds per fruit. These results indicate that the species of bats visiting cactus flowers, as well as the number of visits to flowers, may affect pollination success, and consequently may affect the carrying capacity of the environment in terms of fruit resources for animals that feed on cactus fruits.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary theory proposes that the diversity of chemical structures found in plants is, in large part, the result of selection by herbivores. Because herbivores often feed on chemically similar plants, they should impose selective pressures on plants to diverge chemically or bias community assembly toward chemical divergence. Using a coevolved interaction between a group of chrysomelid beetles and their host plants, I tested whether coexisting plants of the Mexican tropical dry forest tend to be chemically more dissimilar than random. Results show that some of the communities are chemically overdispersed and that overclispersion is related to the tightness of the interaction between plants and herbivores and the spatial scale at which communities are measured. As coevolutionary specialization increases and spatial scale decreases, communities tend to be more chemically dissimilar. At fairly local scales and where herbivores have tight one-to-one interactions with plants, communities have a strong pattern of chemical disparity.},

abstract = {We develop and analyze an explicit multilocus genetic model of coevolution. We assume that interactions between two species (mutualists, competitors, or victim and exploiter) are mediated by a pair of additive quantitative traits that are also subject to direct stabilizing selection toward intermediate optima. Using a weak-selection approximation, we derive analytical results for a symmetric case with equal locus effects and no mutation, and we complement these results by numerical simulations of more general cases. We show that mutualistic and competitive interactions always result in coevolution toward a stable equilibrium with no more than one polymorphic locus per species. Victim-exploiter interactions can lead to different dynamic regimes including evolution toward stable equilibria, cycles, and chaos. At equilibrium, the victim is often characterized by a very large genetic variance, whereas the exploiter is polymorphic in no more than one locus. Compared to related one-locus or quantitative genetic models, the multilocus model exhibits two major new properties. First, the equilibrium structure is considerably more complex. We derive detailed conditions for the existence and stability of various classes of equilibria and demonstrate the possibility of multiple simultaneously stable states. Second, the genetic variances change dynamically, which in turn significantly affects the dynamics of the mean trait values. In particular, the dynamics tend to be destabilized by an increase in the number of loci.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of plants is often thought to be an indicator of underlying biotic and abiotic processes. However, there are relatively feu examples of spatial patterns being analysed to detect an underlying ecological process. Using the spacing of savanna trees in the southern Kalahari as an example. we applied methods of computer simulation modelling and point pattern analysis in an evaluation of their potential for identifying relevant pattern generating processes from snapshot pattern. We compared real tree patterns from the southern Kalahari, derived from aerial photographs, with patterns produced from computer simulation experiments in an investigation of the following questions: does the present pattern of tree distributions allow us to characterize (1) the relative importance of the major driving forces (e.g., competition for moisture, grass fire, herbivory), (2) the spatial dimensions and structures of the underlying processes, and (3) the actual dynamic status of the ecological system (a phase of decline, increase or constancy with respect to tree abundance)? The simulation experiments are based on a well established, spatially explicit. grid-based model that simulates the vegetation dynamics of the major life forms under a realistic rainfall scenario of the southern Kalahari and under the impact of grass fires. herbivory and the formation of localized clumps with increased tree seed availability. For a realistic range of parameters the simulation modal produces long-term coexistence of trees and grasses with tree densities that correspond with densities observed in the field. Both real tree distributions derived from aerial photographs and tree pattern produced bq the model are characterized by a tendency towards even spacing at small scales, clumping at intermediate scales and randomness or clumping at large scales. However. increasing the spatio-temporal correlation in the formation of seed patches in the model caused an increase in the tendency towards clumping in the tree distribution whereas an increase in seed patch numbers led to a decrease in clumping. Within single simulation runs the tree pattern could change in response to the variable rainfall sequences and the corresponding differences in grass fire frequency: periods of slightly increasing tree numbers caused bq higher precipitation were characterized by an increase in tree clumping whereas periods of slightly decreasing tree numbers showed a tendency towards random or even tree spacing. Simulating the transition of an open savanna to a savanna woodland show ed that the tree pattern in the transitional phase can be diagnostic of the underlying process: If the transition was caused by improved moisture conditions the transitional phase was characterized bq increased clumping in the tree pattern. In contrast, a transition caused by an increase in the number of localized tree wed patches led to a characteristic even spacing of trees. Even though the simulated savanna clearly showed non-equilibrium dynamics, simulation results indicate that the tree population in the stimulated area of the southern Kalahari is in a state of long-term tree-grass coexistence with the persisting structure of an open savanna system.},

abstract = {Mutualisms are commonly exploited by cheater species that usurp rewards without providing reciprocal benefits. Yet most studies of selection between mutualist partners ignore interactions with third species and consequently overlook the impact of cheaters on evolution in the mutualism. Here, we explicitly investigate how the abundance of nectar-thieving ants (cheaters) influences selection in a pollination mutualism between humble bees and the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. As suggested in past work with this species, humble bees accounted for most of the seed production (78{\%} +/- 6{\%} [mean +/- SE]) in our high tundra study population and, in the absence of ants, exerted strong selection for large flowers. We tested for indirect effects of ant abundance on seed set through bumble bee pollination services (pollen delivery and pollen export) and a direct effect through flower damage. Ants reduced seed set per flower by 20{\%} via flower damage. As ant density increased within experimental patches, the rate of flower damage rose, but pollen delivery and export did not vary significantly, showing that indirect effects of increased cheater abundance on pollinator service are negligible in this system. To address how ants affect selection for plant participation in the pollination mutualism we tested the impact of ant abundance on selection for humble bee-mediated pollination. Results show that the impact of ants on fitness (seed set) accruing under bumble bee pollination is density dependent in P. viscostan. Selection for bumble bee pollination declined with increasing ant abundance in experimental patches, as predicted if cheaters constrain fitness returns of mutualist partner services. We also examined how ant abundance influences selection on flower size, a key component of plant investment in humble bee pollination. We predicted that direct effects of ants would constrain humble bee selection for large flowers. However, selection on flower size was significantly positive over a wide range of ant abundance (20-80{\%} of plants visited by ants daily). Although high cheater abundance reduces the fitness returns of bumble bee pollination, it does not completely eliminate selection for-bumble bee attraction in P. viscosuln.},

abstract = {We investigated the relationship between parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles and larval parasitism rates of two closely related heliothine; noctuid moths. Heliothis subflexa Guenee is a specialist on plants in the genus Physalis, while Heliothis virescens Fabricius. is an extreme generalist. In North America, these species serve as the only known hosts for the specialist parasitoid Cardiochiles nigriceps Vierick; oviposition into Helicoverpa zea, a non- host, does occur but results in lethal encapsulation, of C. nigriceps' eggs. Heliothis virescens larvae are parasitised by C. nigriceps far more frequently than are H. subflexa larvae. Parasitoid attraction to volatiles emitted by tobacco in response to herbivory by H. virescens has previously been demonstrated. Using field experiments, we examined the possibility that pre-detection defenses against parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles are responsible for H. subflexa's relatively low rates of parasitism by C. nigriceps. Herbivore-damaged plants were significantly more attractive to C. nigriceps than were larvae, larval frass, larval saliva, or damaged leaves alone. Plant species affected parasitoid attraction: tobacco was the most preferred plant species, followed by Physalis angulata, and then cotton. The parasitoid was also more attracted to host species (H. subflexa and H. virescens) than to the non-host species, H. zea. There was an interaction between plant species and herbivore species: each plant species was most attractive when infested by its typical herbivore (e.g., H. virescens on tobacco). We compared these data with those of a previously published experiment on field parasitism of H. virescens and H. subflexa, conducted at the same time and place. Our results indicate that differences in parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles do not contribute to H. subflexa's relatively low parasitism: rate. For the generalist, H. virescens, rates of attraction correspond with rates-of parasitism; for the. specialist, H. subflexa, they do not. Attraction to H: subflexa on P. angulata is greater than to H. virescens on P. angulata, yet parasitism of H. subflexa is much less than parasitism of H. virescens. These results. indicate that pre-detection defenses are not responsible for H. subflexa's low parasitism on P. angulata.},

Cone production, cone size and frugivory also differed significantly among years for the same population. Avian frugivory was only occasionally affected by density of cones per plant, abundance of perches or abundance of other fruiting species, or by habitat. Rodent predation was positively related only to the density of cones per plant and then only in two sites.4 Levels of both avian frugivory and rodent predation significantly increased in populations with higher cone production.5 Both groups of vertebrate frugivores responded to the spatio-temporal variation in cone abundance at a regional scale, discriminating more between juniper populations than between individual plants within a population. The outcome of interactions with frugivores at the individual plant level thus proved more dependent on the whole-population characteristics than on individual attributes.},

abstract = {Herbivores may enhance plant recruitment, but such positive interactions may be overlooked in favour of obvious negative effects of herbivory on propagules. My objective was to determine whether larval insects that feed and develop within fruit of the mangrove Avicennia marina act as mutualist herbivores by increasing the dispersal of propagules without affecting their viability and emerging successfully as adults following dispersal of the propagule by water. Surveys revealed that frugivory is common throughout the mangrove forest, and fruit had up to six exit holes where larvae had emerged as adults. Larval insects did not affect the flotation of propagules with pericarps, a thin structure that provides buoyancy for dispersal by water. In contrast, after simulating germination by removing the pericarp, the majority of propagules with three exit holes floated on average for 20 h longer than those without exit holes, which sank immediately. Based on this evidence that frugivory could increase the dispersal potential of propagules, I predicted that propagules consumed by larval insects should disperse farther than undamaged propagules, and this was tested by quantifying the potential viability of propagules stranded on beaches at increasing distances (up to 20 km) from mangrove forests. Flies and moths emerged as adults after being transported tens of kilometres within mangrove propagules, revealing a novel mode of dispersal. Proportionally fewer potentially viable propagules were supplied to beaches at increasing distances from mangrove forests, however, indicating that larval insects negatively affect recruitment and are thus not acting as mutualist herbivores. Nevertheless, when transported back to the mangrove forest, seedlings established from propagules damaged by larval insects and stranded on beaches. Therefore, although frugivory does not preclude mangrove recruitment, its negative effects in the pre-dispersal environment may be intensified with increasing dispersal distance, thus limiting the long-distance supply of propagules and recruitment of mangroves.},

However, density-dependent recruitment does not necessarily enhance community diversity(14). Furthermore, although density-dependent effects have been found at some life stages in some species(3-13), no study has shown that density-dependent recruitment affects community diversity(14,15). Here we report the results of observations in a lowland, moist forest in the Republic of Panama in which the species identities of 386,027 seeds that arrived at 200 seed traps were compared with the species identities of 13,068 seedlings that recruited into adjacent plots over a 4-year period. Across the 200 sites, recruit seedling diversity was significantly higher than seed diversity. Part of this difference was explained by interspecies differences in average recruitment success.

abstract = {Resistance and tolerance are widely viewed as two alternative adaptive responses to herbivory. However, the traits underlying resistance and tolerance remain largely unknown, as does the genetic architecture of herbivory responses and the prevalence of genetic trade-offs. To address these issues, we measured resistance and tolerance to natural apical meristem damage (AMD) by rabbits in a large field experiment with recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana (developed from a cross between the Columbia x Landsberg erecta ecotypes). We also measured phenological and morphological traits hypothesized to underlie resistance and tolerance to AMD. Recombinant inbred lines differed significantly in resistance (the proportion of replicates within an RIL that resisted herbivory), and early flowering plants with tall apical inflorescences were more likely to experience damage. Tolerance (the difference in fitness between the damaged and undamaged states), also differed significantly among RILs, with some lines overcompensating for damage and producing more fruit in the damaged than undamaged state. Plastic increases in basal branch number, basal branch height, and senescence date in response to damage were all associated with greater tolerance. There was no evidence for a genetic trade-off between resistance and tolerance, an observation consistent with the underlying differences in associated morphological and phenological characters. Selection gradient analysis detected no evidence for direct selection on either resistance or tolerance in this experiment. However, a statistical model indicates that the pattern of selection on resistance depends strongly on the mean level of tolerance, and selection on tolerance depends strongly on the mean level of resistance. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that selection may act to maintain resistance and tolerance at intermediate levels in spatially or temporally varying environments or those with varying herbivore populations.},

abstract = {Many host species interact with a specific parasite within only a fraction of their geographical range. Where host and parasite overlap geographically, selection may be reciprocal constituting a coevolutionary hot spot. Host evolution, however, may be driven primarily by selection imposed by alternative biotic or abiotic factors that occur outside such hot spots. To evaluate the importance of coevolutionary hot spots for host and parasite evolution, we analyse a spatially explicit genetic model for a host that overlaps with a parasite in only part of its geographical range. Our results show that there is a critical amount of overlap beyond which reciprocal selection leads to a coevolutionary response in the host. This critical amount of overlap depends upon the explicit spatial configuration of hot spots. When the amount of overlap exceeds this first critical level, host-parasite coevolution commonly generates stable allele frequency clines rather than oscillations. It is within this region that one of the primary predictions of the geographic mosaic theory is realized, and local maladaptation is prevalent in both species. Past a further threshold of overlap between the species oscillations do evolve, but allele frequencies in both species are spatially synchronous and local maladaptation is absent in both species. A consequence of such transitions between coevolutionary dynamics is that parasite adaptation is inversely proportional to the fraction of its host's range that it occupies. Hence, as the geographical range of a parasite increases, it becomes increasingly maladapted to the host. This suggests a novel mechanism through which the geographical range of parasites may be limited.},

abstract = {The frequency distribution of the number of interactions per species (i.e., degree distribution) within plant-animal mutualistic assemblages often decays as a power-law with an exponential truncation. Such a truncation suggests that there are ecological factors limiting the frequency of supergeneralist species. However, it is not clear whether these patterns can emerge from intrinsic features of the interacting assemblages, such as differences between plant and animal species richness (richness ratio). Here, we show that high richness ratios often characterize plant-animal mutualisms. Then, we demonstrate that exponential truncations are expected in bipartite networks generated by a simple model that incorporates build-up mechanisms that lead to a high richness ratio. Our results provide a simple interpretation for the truncations commonly observed in the degree distributions of mutualistic networks that complements previous ones based on biological effects.

abstract = {This paper investigates the interrelations of some organismal and habitat parameters in two platyrrhine primate communities in French Guiana and Ecuadorian Amazonia. Fifteen habitat and organismal parameters and body weight were retained after a preliminary analysis, on the basis of frequent use and constraints reflected in anatomical specializations. The 16 parameters for 13 platyrrhine species were used for a series of principal components analyses (PCAs). All PCAs on separate or combined communities provided comparable results. The Atelinae, Ateles, Alouatta, and Lagothrix, were clustered together with Pithecia, associated with canopy, mature forest, frugivory, and (to a lesser degree) climb/suspensory locomotion. On the other hand, the three species of Cebus usually formed a loose cluster, located in the center of the cloud of species. Lastly, the Callitrichinae, involving two species of Saguinus and Cebuella, were relatively dispersed and frequently associated with liana forest, lianas, understory, and faunivory. However, Cebuella was consistently isolated and associated with liana forest, lianas, body weight, understory, and vertical supports. In this way, clusters appeared to conform to the major platyrrhine taxonomic groups, supporting the fact that basic ecological and behavioral adaptations have evolved in a phylogenetic context. In addition, the analyses revealed that body weight, forest type and layer, feeding behavior, and locomotion are the most important variables that have apparently shaped or driven the adaptive zones of extant platyrrhines.

We argue that population genetics theory may be misapplied in light of ecological realities that, when recognized, require scrutiny of underlying evolu- tionary assumptions. One ecological reality is that fragment boundaries often do not represent boundaries for mating populations of trees that benefit from long-distance pollination, sometimes abetted by long-distance seed dispersal. Where fragments do not delineate populations, genetic theory of small populations does not apply. Even in spatially isolated populations, where genetic theory may eventually apply, evolutionary ar- guments assume that samples from fragmented populations represent trees that have had sufficient time to experience drift, inbreeding, and ultimately inbreeding depression, an unwarranted assumption where stands in fragments are living relicts of largely unrelated predisturbance populations. Genetic degradation may not be as important as ecological degradation for many decades following habitat fragmentation.},

abstract = {Mutualisms often involve significant costs for participants. Costs are inflicted by mutualists themselves, as well as by associated, non-mutualistic species. These costs are rarely quantified, however, particularly the ones extrinsic to the pairwise interaction. We compare costs inflicted by an obligate mutualist pollinator and two common exploiters of an Arizona yucca over a 2-year period. The magnitude of seed damage from seed and fruit-feeding beetle larvae (Carpophilus longus, Nitidulidae) was similar to damage from the seed-eating larvae of Yucca schottii's pollinator moth Tegeticula yuccasella (Prodoxidae), averaging about 15 seeds destroyed per fruit in each case. The two seed predators usually fed within the same fruits, although rarely side by side. In contrast, the presence of fruit-galling moth larvae (Prodoxus y-inversus, Prodoxidae) appeared to benefit the yucca: individual Tegeticula destroyed only half as many seeds in galled fruits as they did in ungalled fruits. We discuss three general implications of these results. Firstly, the costs of non-mutualists to the two mutualistic partners are not necessarily parallel. Secondly, measurable costs of non-mutualists do not necessarily translate into an impact on the success of the mutualism itself, because they may be incurred after mutualistic activities take place. Finally, the costs of mutualists to each other can differ substantially depending on the presence or absence of non- mutualistic species.},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm for the disproportionate number of flowering plants is the unique coevolution that they underwent with pollinating insects. The theory underlying this biotic pollination hypothesis contradicts more generally accepted evolutionary theory. Furthermore, various lines of empirical evidence falsify the biotic pollination hypothesis: (a) several lineages of plants were insect pollinated - angiosperms, Gnetales, Bennettitales, Cheirolepidiaceae, Medullosales, and Cycadales - yet only the first four were ever diverse or underwent radiations; (b) the predicted rise in insect diversity, which was coupled with angiosperm radiation, does not appear in the fossil record; (c) the family Poaceae (grasses) are wind pollinated, yet are exceptionally diverse and species-rich; and (d) the family Formicidae (ants) were not pollinators, yet are exceptionally species-rich and ecologically dominant. I enumerate many alternate (and seldom investigated) hypotheses for these patterns of seed plant diversity, keeping in mind that although I show that insect pollination was neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for large numbers of species, it may have played a substantial role in both plant and insect speciation. Alternatively, existing theory regarding the biotic pollination hypothesis can be refined in an attempt to eliminate the aforementioned empirical anomalies and theoretical inconsistencies.

During the experimental season and in the following year we quantified responses in terms of survival, growth, and seed production of reproductive plants Matrix population models were used to calculate population growth rate using the demographic parameters recorded in permanent plots and respective treatment groups Seed production was not limited by pollen availability, and we found no evidence of a cost of reproduction. Leaf removal had either no effect or a negative effect on future performance, depending oil the timing of removal. Defoliation early in the season reduced current seed production and future growth. whereas removal during fruit development affected performance in the following year. Demographic models suggest that leaf damage has a smaller negative impact than flower removal oil overall performance in this population. Our results suggest that the source-sink paths vary over the season and that the timing of herbivory may influence the extent to which effects are carried over to subsequent reproductive seasons.},

We develop simple genetic models of coevolution between three species where interactions are mediated by quantitative traits.

We use this model to explore how genetic correlations between the two traits in the multivariate species shape the evolutionary dynamics and outcomes of three species interactions. Our results suggest that genetic correlations are most important when at least one of the interactions is between a predator and prey or parasite and host. In these cases, genetic correlations between traits lead to a wide variety of novel coevolutionary outcomes and dynamics. In particular, genetic correlations can affect the existence and stability of coevolutionary equilibrium points, and they can lead to recurrent or permanent maladaptation. When the three species interact only as competitors or mutualists, however, genetic correlations have no effect on the outcome of coevolution. In all cases, our results reveal the surprising conclusion that both positive and negative genetic correlations between traits have qualitatively identical effects on coevolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Although mistletoe is typically viewed as a parasite of juniper in a two-way interaction, its role may become neutral or even mutualistic when their common avian seed dispersing agents are considered as a three-way interaction. In the study area, wintering avian frugivores forage on both one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) berries and on the fruit of its associated mistletoe (Phoradendron juniperinum). Three major findings emerged from our studies that support a three-way interaction and the hypothesis of conditional interactions. First, mistletoes provide a stable resource for shared avian seed dispersers; junipers do not. Whereas juniper berry production varied 10- to 15-fold over the 3 years of our study, mistletoe fruit abundance did not vary significantly. Second, the abundance of avian seed dispersal agents, such as Townsend's solitaires (Myadestes townsendi), is strongly tied to the abundance of Juniper berries in mast years and mistletoe fruits in all years. In fact, the best overall predictor of their common avian seed dispersal agents was the abundance of mistletoe; stands with mistletoe attracted up to 3 times more avian frugivores than stands with little or no mistletoe. Thus, mistletoe berries can serve as the main attractor for birds that disperse juniper berries. Third, in agreement with the hypothesis that mistletoe can benefit junipers by attracting and supporting greater populations of avian seed dispersal agents, the number of juniper seedlings was more than 2-fold greater in stands with high mistletoe density compared with stands that had little or no mistletoe. Results suggest that the occurrence of a three-way interaction, in the presence of environmental variation (in this case, annual variation in juniper berry crops), may change the ecological roles of associated species. A conceptual model is presented to illustrate how the role of mistletoe may range from parasitic to mutualistic, while the role of avian seed dispersers may conversely range from mutualistic to parasitic, the latter by acting as vectors for the spread of mistletoe.},

abstract = {We examined the hypothesis that tree-ring analyses of juvenile growth traits could be used to predict herbivory during mature years. At Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, USA, some pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) are highly susceptible to the stem- boring moth, Dioryctria albovittella, and suffer chronic attack, while other adjacent trees are resistant and have remained relatively moth-free for years. Five major patterns emerged: (1) Susceptible trees suffer from 11 times more shoots killed per tree and produce {\textless}0.05 times as many cones as resistant trees. (2) This herbivore is largely restricted to reproductively mature trees that, at this site, are generally older than 46 yr. (3) Analysis of tree-ring. data from resistant and susceptible trees shows that trees that eventually became susceptible grew more vigorously during their attack-free juvenile years than resistant trees (growth rings were 29{\%} wider). However, when they matured and suffered chronic herbivory, susceptible trees produced growth rings 13{\%} smaller than resistant trees. (4) Although previous studies showed that resistance was associated with,higher oleoresin flow, we did not observe this pattern. Instead, we found that resistance was best correlated with slower juvenile growth rates. Current-year shoots of susceptible mature trees averaged 50{\%} larger than those on resistant mature trees. (5) Tree-ring analyses supported the hypothesis of a trade-off between growth and resistance. This study shows that dendrochronology can be used as a tool to predict future herbivory and demonstrates that the fastest growing juvenile trees suffer the poorest performance decades later when they become moth-susceptible mature trees. Furthermore, it illustrates that traits associated with plant development can greatly affect herbivore distributions, and that herbivore selection pressures on juvenile trees can be very different than on mature trees.; },

abstract = {Long-lived trees experience different levels of damage due to mammalian herbivores. To untangle the mechanisms that underlie this variation, we combined chemical with dendrochronological analyses to study variation in browsing on Western redcedars (Thuja plicata) on Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada). Since the last glaciation, Haida Gwaii forests had lacked large herbivore browser until Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus heimonus sitkensis) were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century. Dendrochronology yielded information on radial growth and plant annual responses to environmental stresses including herbivory. Secondary metabolite content and plant nutritional quality provided insights into proximate causes of food choices made by herbivores. We sampled lightly- and heavily-browsed young trees at four sites: three clear-cut sites with high browsing pressure and one old-growth forest site where browsing pressure had, until recently, been lower. Heavily-browsed young trees had lower concentrations of secondary metabolites and were of lower nutritive value than lightly-browsed trees at all sites. Under high browsing pressure, tree growth patterns suggested that all young trees were initially severely browsed until some trees, currently scored as lightly-browsed, started to escape deer. At the old- growth site, both lightly- and heavily-browsed trees tended to have lower overall average secondary metabolite concentrations than those of all other sites, a trend possibly related to greater canopy closure. Lightly-browsed trees were older than heavily-browsed ones which resulted, during the period of lower browsing pressure, in higher growth rate and a same pattern of change in growth from one year to the next year. This suggests that, under low browsing pressure, selection of young trees related to chemical defense was weak and that growth differences due to other factors than browsing could be expressed. Under strong browsing pressure, however, all young trees had equally low growth rates until trees with better genetic potential to produce effective defenses were able to escape deer. This suggests that selection by deer could occur on a long-lived tree.},

These results support the hypothesis that resistance to herbivory may be an important component of plant fitness in unproductive vegetation. However, the correlation between palatability and community composition may be interpreted as a positive association between traits that lead to high competitive ability and herbivory resistance.

We develop a genetic model of temporally variable coevolution that incorporates stochastic fluctuations between mutualism and antagonism.

Using an analytical approximation, we show that matching traits will coevolve when the geometric mean interaction is mutualistic. When this condition does not hold, polymorphism and trait mismatching are maintained, and coevolutionary cycles may result. Numerical simulations verify this prediction and suggest that it remains robust in the presence of temporal autocorrelation. These results are compared with those from spatial models with unrestricted movement. The comparisons demonstrate that gene flow is unnecessary for generating empirical patterns predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.},

This synthesis incorporates research on the ecology and evolution within communities over short timescales (community genetics and diffuse coevolution), as well as macroevolutionary timescales (community phylogenetics and co-diversification of communities). As we discuss here, preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis that there is a dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution within communities, yet researchers have not yet demonstrated convincingly whether, and under what circumstances, it is important for biologists to bridge community ecology and evolutionary biology. Answering this question will have important implications for both basic and applied problems in biology.},

abstract = {Recent studies have alerted us to the potential for conflicts between pathogen- and herbivore-induced plant defenses. The lack of studies on the induced chemical changes that simultaneous insect and pathogen attacks have on the host plant has become apparent. In the present study, we found that pepper plant volatile profiles can be differentially induced by compatible and incompatible bacterial infection and beet armyworm (BAW) damage when applied alone or in combination upon the same host. We also found that plants under simultaneous compatible bacterial and BAW attack are able to produce volatiles in quantities greater than those produced by healthy plants in response to BAW feeding. In contrast, plants exposed to the incompatible pathogen challenge showed a total volatile release below the level of healthy plants exposed to BAW damage. This suppression of BAW-induced volatiles coincided with increased methyl salicylate production from incompatible bacteria-infected plants. Feeding choice experiments revealed that, when given a choice, BAW larvae fed significantly more on leaves of plants infected with the incompatible bacteria as soon as 2 d after inoculation, while a significant increase in insect feeding on the plants infected with the compatible bacterial strain was not seen until day 4 after inoculation. Additionally, survival for third instars to pupation was significantly higher when feeding on infected plants than on healthy plants, regardless of compatibility. These results are indicative of lowered herbivore defenses due to disease progression on the plants.},

abstract = {Fragmentation that alters mutualistic relationships between plants and frugivorous animals may reduce the seed dispersal of trees. We examined the effects of forest fragmentation on the distributions of seeds and seedlings of a Central Amazon endemic tree, Duckeodendron cestroides. In the dry seasons of 2002-2004, seeds and first-year seedlings were counted within wedge-shaped transects centered around Duckeodendron adults in fragments and nearby continuous forests at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragmentation Project. Analyses showed that fragmentation reduced seed dispersal quantity and quality. The percent and distance of dispersed seeds were both twice as great in continuous forest as in fragments. The distances of each tree's five furthest dispersed seeds were three times greater in continuous forest than fragments. Over the 3-yr study, 20 times more seeds were dispersed more than 10 m from parent crowns in continuous forest than fragments. A regression analysis showed more dispersed seeds at all distances in continuous forest than fragments. Dispersal differences were strong in 2002 and 2004, years of large fruit crops, but weak or absent in 2003, when fruit production was low. As distance from parent crowns increased, the number of seedlings declined more rapidly in fragments than continuous forest. Distance-dependent mortality between the seed and seedling stages appeared to be more important in continuous forest than fragments. This research provides ample, indirect evidence demonstrating that forest fragmentation can result in the breakdown of a seed dispersal mutualism, potentially jeopardizing the reproduction of a rare, tropical tree.},

abstract = {Genomic duplication through polyploidy has played a central role in generating the biodiversity of flowering plants. Nonetheless, how polyploidy shapes species interactions or the ecological dynamics of communities remains largely unknown. Here we provide evidence from a 4 year study demonstrating that the evolution of polyploidy has reshaped the interactions between a widespread plant and three species of phytophagous moths. Our results show that polyploidy has produced non- uniform effects, with polyploids less attacked by one insect species, but significantly more attacked by two other species. These results suggest that the evolution of plant polyploidy may not generally confer uniform resistance to multiple species of insect herbivores. In the absence of such a uniform release, the extreme evolutionary success of polyploid plants is probably due to factors other than escape from herbivory. Together, these results suggest that a primary consequence of plant polyploidy may be to shape the ecological structure of plant-insect interactions, thereby providing opportunities for diversification in both plant and insect taxa.},

We base our model on the interaction between. malaria parasites and their mosquito hosts and thus describe the epidemiological dynamics with the Macdonald-Ross equation of malaria epidemiology. The qualitative predictions of the model are most sensitive to the cost of the immune response and to the intensity of transmission. If transmission is weak or the cost of immunity is low, the system evolves to a coevolutionarily stable equilibrium at intermediate levels of investment (and, generally, at a low frequency of resistance). At a higher cost of immunity and as transmission intensifies, the system is not evolutionarily stable but rather cycles around intermediate levels of investment. At more intense transmission, neither host nor parasite invests any resources in dominating its partner so that no resistance is observed in the population. These results may help to explain the lack of encapsulated malaria parasites generally observed in natural populations of mosquito vectors, despite strong selection pressure for resistance in areas of very intense transmission.},

Here, I test the hypothesis that aggressive ant bodyguards of plants deter pollinators, and explore mechanisms by which Ferocactus wislizeni, an extrafloral nectary bearing cactus, limits conflicts between its pollinators and bodyguards. Flower visitation by ants and pollinating bees differed among plants tended by four different ant species. The ant species most rarely found in flowers showed the strongest aversion to F. wislizeni flower petals in laboratory assays, suggesting that those structures may include an ant-deterrent. Species-specific estimates of mean ant abundance within flowers and aggressiveness towards other arthropods were used to distinguish the relative threat of ant attack in flowers on plants tended by each ant species. Pollinator surveys in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated that bee visitation rates and the duration of flower occupation differed among plants with different ant associates, decreasing as the threat of ant attack increased. Flowers on plants tended by Solenopsis xyloni, the best ant bodyguard, were more dangerous than those on plants tended by three milder species, due to that ants' greater aggressiveness and abundance within flowers. These flowers were visited by pollinators least frequently and for less time per visit, and produced fruits with significantly lower total seed mass, fewer seeds, and lighter individual seeds, relative to fruits from similarly-sized plants tended by three other ant species. As a result, the best bodyguard may indirectly constrain plant reproduction in some settings. Conflicts between mutualistic guilds may be particularly common in generalized systems, where there is variation in partner quality and in the relative importance of the protection and pollination mutualisms.},

Two of these (Cerajocera ceratocera [Diptera: Tephritidae] and Isocolus cf. rogenhoferi [Hymenoptera: Cynipidae]) were specialists, and the third (Eucosma cana [Lepidoptera: Tortricidae]) was a generalist on the subfamily Cynaroiideae to which C. scabiosa belongs. All three species increased their herbivory level with size of host plant population. We compared the explanatory power of three measures of population isolation: 1) the traditional measure of distance to nearest- neighbour population, 2) cumulative proximity of all surrounding populations, and 3) a measure termed biological proximity, combining the effects of distance to other populations and their size. Both 2) and 3) explained surprisingly little of the observed herbivory. Thus population size and distance to nearest-neighbour population were the two best predictors of level of herbivory.},

Plant recruitment in arid environments often Occurs only in years with above average rainfall or in safe sites Under the canopy of nurse plants that provide shelter from high temperatures arid low moisture. Associations of establishing seedlings with adult plants are referred to as nurse-protege interactions and are thought to be commensalisms in which seedlings benefit from the micro-environment created by adult plants with no effect for the latter. This phenomenon is thought to be more frequent in harsh than in mild environments and appears to Occur frequently in deserts and arid and semi-arid bionics. Here, we investigate whether nurse-protege interactions are more common in and environments by searching the published literature from the Previous 92 years using the terms nurse plants. protege plants, facilitation, nucleation and facultative mutualism. We then quantitatively compared these reports from arid zones to other environments. A total of 296 papers were found which referred to nurse-protege interactions. More than half (158) focused on arid and semi-arid zones. This information was also used to explore hypotheses of potential causative forces that might have selected for Such interactions in the arid zones Such as seed trapping, nutrient. moisture, protection from browsing or trampling and support availability. Because of the large number of different nurse species (147, from 98 genera and 40 families) and protege species (429, from 273 genera arid 84 families), described across a diversity of environments, we suggest that there may be more than one causative factor selecting for nurse-protege interactions in arid and semi-arid environments.},

All plants of H. spinosa (n = 80) were heavily attacked by herbivores in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, where most plants were attacked by different types of herbivores during each year of the study. Plants lost about 50{\%} of their reproductive structures during the study period.

abstract = {Understanding plant community responses to combinations of biotic and abiotic factors is critical for predicting ecosystem response to environmental change. However, studies of plant community regulation have seldom considered how responses to such factors vary with the different phases of the plant growth cycle. To address this deficit we studied an aquatic plant community in an ecosystem subject to gradients in mute swan (Cygnus olor) herbivory, riparian shading, water temperature and distance downstream of the river source. We quantified abundance, species richness, evenness, flowering and dominance in relation to biotic and abiotic factors during the growth-, peak-, and recession-phases of the plant growth cycle. We show that the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors varied between plant community properties and between different phases of the plant growth cycle. Herbivory became more important during the later phases of peak abundance and recession due to an influx of swans from adjacent pasture fields. Shading by riparian vegetation also had a greater depressing effect on biomass in later seasons, probably due to increased leaf abundance reducing light intensity reaching the aquatic plants. The effect of temperature on community diversity varied between upstream and downstream sites by altering the relative competitiveness of species at these sites. These results highlight the importance of seasonal patterns in the regulation of plant community structure and function by multiple factors.},

During the dry season, irrigated plants in gaps increased total leaf area significantly more than did irrigated plants in the shaded understory. Over the same dry season, control plants in gaps and in the shaded understory lost similar amounts of leaf area. Seedlings in understory were suppressed in stem height and biomass in both irrigated and control plots; these measures were greater in gaps and greatest in irrigated gaps (height). Roots were similar in length in all treatments, but greater in biomass in gaps than understory due to greater proliferation of secondary roots in control and irrigated gaps than in control and irrigated understory. This experiment demonstrates both water and light limitation during the first dry season after germination. V. surinamensis seedlings are capable of survival and modest growth of leaf area in the deep shade of the understory in moist locations; they are severely disadvantaged in shaded understory subject to drought, where most seeds fall and most seedlings establish. The broken canopy of a gap allows shoot and consequently root growth that permits seedlings to survive seasonal drought.},

abstract = {Understanding how terrestrial ecosystems function requires a combined aboveground-belowground approach, because of the importance of feedbacks that occur between herbivores, producers, and the decomposer subsystem. In this paper, we identify several mechanisms by which herbivores can indirectly affect decomposer organisms and soil processes through altering the quantity and quality of resources entering the soil. We show that these mechanisms are broadly similar in nature for both foliar and root herbivory, regardless of whether they operate in the short term as a result of physiological responses of individual plants to herbivore attack or long-term following alteration of plant community structure, by herbivores and subsequent changes in the quality of litter inputs to soil. We propose that a variety of possible mechanisms is responsible for the idiosyncratic nature of herbivore effects on soil biota and ecosystem function; positive, negative, or neutral effects of herbivory are possible depending upon the balance of these different mechanisms. However, we predict that positive effects of herbivory on soil biota and soil processes are most common in ecosystems of high soil fertility and high consumption rates, whereas negative effects are most common in unproductive ecosystems with low consumption rates. The significance of multiple-species herbivore communities is also emphasized, and we propose that if resource use complementarity among herbivore species or functional groups leads to greater total consumption of phytomass, and thus greater net herbivory, then both positive and negative consequences of increasing herbivore diversity for belowground properties and processes are theoretically possible. Research priorities are highlighted and include a need for comparative studies of herbivore impacts on above- and belowground processes across ecosystems of varying productivity, as well as a heed for experimental testing of the influence of antiherbivore defense compounds on complex multitrophic interactions in the rhizosphere and the significance of multiple herbivore species communities on these plant-soil interactions.},

abstract = {Sprouting in trees, which results in the production of secondary trunks, is an induced response to injury or to a dramatic change in surrounding environmental conditions. This article reviews the forestry and ecology literature to produce an integrated view of the role of sprouting in both disturbed habitats and closed-canopy forests. Sprouting is a universal attribute of temperate angiosperm trees through the sapling stage of development but is much less common among gymnosperms. Four basic types of sprout morphologies are described: collar sprouts from the base of the trunk, sprouts from specialized underground stems (lignotubers and rhizomes), sprouts from roots, and opportunistic sprouts from layered branches. In a survey of 68 species of trees native to northeastern North America, 41 {\%} were found to retain the ability to sprout from the collar into adulthood, 26{\%} sprout from branch layers under natural conditions, and 25{\%} have the capacity to form root suckers, Sprouting in seedlings promotes their survival under a variety of stressful conditions, including suppression by canopy trees, herbivory, site exposure, and desiccation. In contrast, sprouting in mature trees extends the life span of the individual following damage and, in the case of root-suckering species, promotes the colonization of new ground. Although the sprouting of mature trees is more conspicuous than the sprouting of seedlings, its ecological significance is not as great. As abroad generalization, species that grow in stressful sites or sites with frequent disturbances are likely to sprout more vigorously and to retain the sprouting ability longer than are species that grow in less stressful sites or sites with less frequent disturbance, Near the limits of a species' altitudinal or latitudinal range, the production of basal sprouts, root suckers, rhizomes, and/or branch layers allows trees to spread into adjacent areas, thereby circumventing the difficulties associated with seedling establishment.},

We conducted an experiment to study the effects of defoliation and soil fungi on interactions between Centaurea melitensis, an invasive annual from Eurasia, and Nassella pulchra, a native Californian bunchgrass. Defoliation of C. melitensis reduced its final biomass in all species-fungicide treatments, except when C. melitensis was grown with both Nassella and non-treated soil fungi at the same time. In this treatment, the biomass of clipped C. melitensis plants was equal to that of unclipped plants, indicating that soil fungi and Nassella promoted a compensatory response in the weed. Overall, the biomass of C melitensis was 44{\%} lower when soil fungi were reduced. However, in soil not treated with fungicide, the total biomass of C melitensis increased in the presence of Nassella, but decreased when it was grown alone. When stressed by defoliation, C. melitensis may benefit from a form of mycorrhizae-mediated parasitism through a common mycorrhizal network, or Nassella may alter the fungal community in a way that enhances the positive direct effects of soil fungi on Centaurea.},

However, while many empirical studies have demonstrated local parasite adaptation, others have failed to demonstrate it, or have shown local parasite maladaptation. Researchers have suggested that gene flow can swamp local parasite-host dynamics and produce local adaptation only at certain geographical scales; others have argued that evolutionary lags can account for both null and maladaptive results. In this paper, we use item response theory (IRT) to test whether host range influences the likelihood of parasites locally adapting to their hosts. We collated 32 independent experiments testing for local adaptation, where parasites could be assigned as having either broad or narrow host ranges (BHR and NHR, respectively). Twenty-five tests based on BHR parasites had a significantly lower average effect size than seven NHR tests, indicating that studies based on BHR parasites are less likely to demonstrate local parasite adaptation. We argue that this may relate to evolutionary lags during diffuse coevolution of BHR parasites with their hosts, rather than differences in experimental approaches or other confounds between BHR and NHR studies.},

abstract = {A coevolutionary model is developed of the interaction between a host and an internal parasitoid, where the outcome of parasitism depends upon the extent to which individual hosts invest in resistance mechanisms and individual parasitoids in countermeasures (virulence). The host and parasitoid are assumed to have coupled population dynamics (of Nicholson-Bailey form) and to be composed of a series of asexual clones with different levels of resistance and virulence. Investment in resistance and virulence mechanisms is assumed to be costly. The model has two main outcomes. First, if resistance is relatively costly compared to virulence, the host may be selected not to invest in resistance mechanisms despite parasitoid investment in virulence, in effect trading off the risks of parasitism against the savings in costs. A number of cases which appear to correspond to this result have been reported. Second, for most other feasible parameter values, an arms race occurs between host and parasitoid, until effective resistance becomes so costly that the host abandons defence. This abandonment is followed by a reduction in parasitoid virulence and the cycle begins again. These cycles may explain reports of persistent additive genetic variation in resistance and virulence, and may also contribute towards population dynamic stability.},

abstract = {We investigated fruit damage by insects as well as fruit abortion in relation to the mutualism between Juniperus communis, a fleshy-fruited. plant dominant in the high mountains of southeastern Spain, and its bird disperser assemblage. For two years, we performed field experiments to analyse fruit selection by birds, offering birds different types of anomalous fruits (unripe, aborted, pulp-sucker infested and seed-predator attacked) and comparing the removal rate to that of ripe, healthy, control fruits. In addition, ne studied the proportion of fruits attacked by the seed predator in samples of fruits which, after manipulation and rejection by birds, we found lying underneath plants. We compared these data to values in samples of fruits which we took directly From plants. Finally, over four years, the abundance of predispersal-depredated seeds in the seed rain dispersed by birds was compared with the abundance in seeds taken directly from plants. Fruit-choice experiments showed that unripe, aborted and Fruits attacked by pest insects (both pulp sucker and seed predator) were strongly counterselected by these frugivorous birds. The proportion of fruits attacked by seed-predator in the sample of fruits manipulated and rejected was significantly higher than in the fruits taken from plants. For all study years, the proportion of depredated seeds was significantly lower in the sample of seeds dispersed by birds than in the sample of seeds taken from plants. Bird response to pests was not categorically to accept or reject fruit, but rather was influenced by pest density. Birds showed two different levels of fruit selection, depending on the type of fruit: visual discrimination, against Fruits that are unripe, aborted and infested by the pulp sucker: and within-beak discrimination, against fruits attacked by the seed predator. In the study, both pests either died or left the fruit when ripe, and therefore frugivorous birds did not interfere directly with frugivorous insects. On the contrary, insects did interfere indirectly with birds, promoting the rejection of pest-attacked fruits by birds. Bird dispersers overcame the predispersal interference of pest fruit damage and Fruit abortion and increased the proportion of healthy seeds in the seed rain. This fact, together with the great quantity of seeds dispersed by birds, reinforces the importance of birds as plant mutualists.},

On Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, El Ni (n) over tildeo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events followed by mild dry seasons have been shown to stimulate variation in community-wide fruit production. This variation has been postulated to lead to famine in frugivore and granivore populations, but few if any studies have assessed further implications for other members of the ecological community. This study examined the ways in which variation in fruit production associated with an El Ni (n) over tildeo event on BCI may influence demographic and evolutionary traits in a plant species that is only consumed by frugivores during periods of fruit scarcity. Specifically, I assessed the effects of herbivory by collared peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) on demographic Fates and patterns in the terrestrial bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae. Aechmea magdalenae usually suffers little or no herbivory, and rain forest collared peccaries, which are primarily frugivorous, have not previously been reported to eat this species. Rates of survival and reproduction of 296 A. magdalenae rosettes in three transects of differing densities were recorded from 1997 through 1999. Mortality rates due to herbivory increased significantly from 1997 to 1999 and showed a close correspondence with enhanced and then decreased rates of community-wide fruit production associated with the 1997 ENSO. The densest portions of the A. magdalenae population showed lower mortality rates and higher rates of reproduction than did the less dense regions. Over the study period, A. magdalenae populations decreased by 45 percent. The implications of periodic herbivory by hungry frugivores are discussed with respect to population regulation, seedling dispersal, and evolution of A. magdalenae dense growth habit.},

No agamospermous seeds were produced when both wind and insects were excluded from female cones; and the exclusion of wind-vectored pollen alone did not eliminate seed set, because insects were able to reach the cone. Based on enclosure pollination tests, each weevil pollinates an average 26.2 ovules per cone and each thrips 2.4 ovules per cone. These pollinators visited similar numbers of ovules per cone in fluorescent dye tests that traced insect movement through cones. Fluorescent dye granules deposited by Cycadothrips were concentrated around the micropyle of each visited ovule, the site of pollen droplet release, where pollen must be deposited to achieve pollination. In contrast, Tranes weevils left dye scattered on different areas of each visited ovule, indicating that chance plays a greater role in this system. Each weevil and 25 thrips delivered 6.2 and 5.2 pollen grains, respectively, on average, to each visited ovule per cone, based on examination of dissected pollen canals. In sum, the pollination potential of 25 Cycadothrips approximates that of one Tranes weevil.},

Instable communities of a few species of long-lived plants, variances in seed and seedling survival are immense, so seed-to-seedling transitions have little influence on overall population dynamics. However, when seedlings in different circumstances have very different chances of survival-in ecological succession, for example, or when dispersed seeds escape density-dependent mortality near parent frees-the biased survival of dispersed seeds or seedlings in some places rather than others results in pervasive demographic impacts.},

Host species could affect parasite interactions with both herbivores and pollinators due to the uptake of defensive compounds and nutrients. However, the effects of different host species on parasitic plants have not been experimentally tested in the field. I determined the effect of two native host species, an alkaloid-producing, nitrogen-fixing lupine and non- alkaloid, non-nitrogen-fixing grass, on herbivory, pollination, and reproduction of the hemiparasitic plant Indian paintbrush (Castilleja indivisa). Within this experiment, I manipulated herbivory and pollination to determine their effects on Indian paintbrush reproduction. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced three times as many seeds and were more attractive to pollinators than Indian paintbrush parasitizing grass. However, there was no effect of host species on early season or floral herbivory. In addition, MANOVA revealed that host species influenced the response of Indian paintbrush female reproduction to experimentally manipulated herbivory and pollination treatments. Thus, the effect of hosts on parasites is mediated by interactions with herbivores and pollinators, and both direct and indirect effects may shape the selective pressures mediating interactions between hosts and parasites.},

Several life-history traits necessary for the evolution of obligate mutualism are common traits within the Prodoxidae, and only active pollination and modified mouthparts appear to have been novel traits in the yucca moths.

However, empirical evidence from natural ecosystems for the stabilizing effect of space is sparse. 2. We use a Neotropical ant-plant and its ant symbionts to show how mutual dispersal limitation brings about the stable persistence of coexistence and mutualism. 3. We demonstrate that two ant genera exhibit hierarchies in competitive ability, fecundity and dispersal ability, which suggests that a competition-colonization trade-off could be producing coexistence. However, we also show that this trade-off is not a sufficient explanation for coexistence. 4. Instead, we provide evidence that a dispersal-fecundity trade-off stabilizes the system by making each genus more dispersal-limited in a different portion of the environment. In this way, dispersal limitation can be seen as a form of environmental niche partitioning. 5. We also find that regeneration niche partitioning and a competition-colonization trade-off may help to bring about local mixing. 6. This study shows that care needs to be taken in identifying the critical mechanisms producing coexistence. Trade-offs between different stages of colonization may be more important for explaining coexistence than any trade-offs between competitive ability and colonization rate.},

abstract = {Brood parasitism in birds is one of the best examples of coevolutionary interactions in vertebrates. Coevolution between hosts and parasites is assumed to occur because the parasite imposes strong selection pressures on its hosts, reducing their fitness and thereby favouring counter-adaptations (e.g. egg rejection) which, in turn, select for parasite resistance (e.g. egg mimicry). Great spotted cuckoos (Clamator glandarius) are usually considered a brood parasite with eggs almost perfectly mimicking those of their host, the magpie (Pica pica). However, Cl. glandarius also exploits South African hosts with very different eggs, both in colour and size, while the Cl. glandarius eggs are similar to those laid in nests of European hosts. Here, we used spectrophotometric techniques for the first time to quantify mimicry of parasitic eggs for eight different host species. We found: (1) non-significant differences in appearance of Cl. glandarius eggs laid in nests of different host species, although eggs laid in South Africa and Europe differed significantly; (2) contrary to the general assumption that Cl. glandarius eggs better mimic those of the main host in Europe (R pica), Cl. glandarius eggs more closely resembled those of the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana), a potential host in which there is no evidence of recent parasitism; (3) the appearance of Cl. glandarius eggs was not significantly related to the appearance of host eggs. We discuss three possible reasons why Cl. glandarius eggs resemble eggs of some of their hosts. We suggest that colouration of Cl. glandarius eggs is an apomorphic trait, and that variation between eggs laid in South African and European host nests is due to genetic isolation among these populations and not due to variation in colouration of host eggs.

We hypothesized that fishing influences assemblages directly by reducing populations of target fish species, and indirectly by reducing predation on sea urchins, intensifying herbivory, and causing ``barrens'' of encrusting coralline algae. We examined how the possible effects of fishing varied with physical exposure of the coastline. The composition of fish assemblages differed significantly between sites within no-take reserves and fished reference sites. Abundances and sizes of predatory fishes targeted by local fisheries were greater in no-take reserves than in fished areas. Sea urchin densities, the extent of coralline barrens, and the structure of the algal and invertebrate benthic assemblages showed clear variation associated with exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves, but weak effects of protection from human use. Densities of the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula were significantly greater along the windward than along the leeward sides of the islands, and were positively correlated with the extent of coralline barrens. In contrast, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was more abundant along the leeward sides of islands and showed indirect responses to protection at Giannutri, where purple sea urchins tended to have greater densities at fished than at protected sites. Protection from fishing influenced fish assemblages directly, and benthic assemblages indirectly, but the latter effect was observed only at sites with lower physical exposure. Indirect effects of fishing and recovery of assemblages within marine protected areas through cascading trophic interactions are likely to vary depending on local physical conditions and on the characteristics of species that are locally dominant.},

Variability of size distributions of populations in more complex communities has been neglected. The effects of seeding density (35 or 350 seeds/species/m(2)) and presence of small vertebrates on the variability of size distributions were studied for a total of 1,920 individuals of 4 species in replicated synthetic communities of 18 species in northern Illinois. End-of season height and above-ground biomass were measured for prairie perennials Dalea purpurea (purple prairie clover), Echinacea purpurea (purple coneflower), Desmanthus illinoensis (Illinois bundleflower) and Heliopsis helianthoides (early sunflower). Variability in biomass distribution of the four target species was twice as great at low than at high densities when small vertebrates were excluded. Our results suggest that inter- and intraspecific competition may affect all individuals more under high-density conditions, thereby reducing the variability in their biomass distributions within this community. This result, a consequence of plant-plant interaction, is obscured when small birds or mammals are present, presumably because either or both add variance that overwhelms the pattern.},

The specificity of host resistance and parasitoid virulence is thus a key factor in host-parasitoid coevolution. A continuum of strategies exists, from strict specificity to a generalist strategy. The optimal level of specificity may differ in host and parasitoid. I investigated the optimal level of resistance specificity using a model in which the host could be attacked by two parasitoid species, with variable levels of defense specificity. The fitness of a parasitoid attacking two host species with different levels of virulence specificity was also modeled. Finally, a fluctuating environment was simulated by introducing variable probabilities of encounters between antagonistic species over several generations. If the frequency of encounters with the antagonistic species is fixed, then both host and parasitoid gain from a strategy of exclusive specialization toward the most frequent antagonist. If the frequency of encounters fluctuates between generations, generalist host resistance and partially specialist parasitoid virulence are favored. Generalist host resistance may be considered to be a bet-hedging response to an unpredictable environment. This asymmetry in host-parasitoid coevolution may account for some of the genetic structures observed in the field for host-parasitoid associations.},

To retain landscape mosaics of woody and grassland vegetation, preserve managers need to understand how vegetation boundaries shift. Woody plant colonization of grasslands without fire is widely known in mediterranean-climate regions, yet few generalities have emerged for woody colonizer traits or colonization processes. Here we report on our research into processes of grassland colonization by summer deciduous coastal sage scrub species of semiarid southern California. We used four coastal sage shrub dominants to elucidate dynamics of grassland colonization and within-stand replacement. We measured seed production, dispersal, and storage; seedling numbers; and growth and flowering for two years in three grassland-scrub sites. Traits of our four species matched those of native woody colonizers as described in other systems and included: recruitment over a range of site conditions, annual production of large seed crops, long-distance dispersal (into grassland), presence in grassland seed banks, seedling recruitment in gaps, rapid seedling growth, and low susceptibility to seedling herbivory. In a factorial experiment, we used our study species to test a set of hypotheses that explain grassland colonization by a northern Californian shrub species and found overall greater importance of biotic disturbances but less influence of water availability. Although generalities can be made about some native woody colonizer traits, to maintain mediterranean grassland-shrubland mosaics we encourage land managers to devise monitoring and management plans that sufficiently address local shrub species traits and environmental factors. },

abstract = {In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed.The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km2 watershed had 1570 km2 of forest in 1997, 1080 km2 of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km2 of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4{\%} per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2{\%} per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.},

abstract = {Moderate rates of herbivory can enhance primary production. This hypothesis has led to a controversy as to whether such positive effects can result in mutualistic interactions between plants and herbivores. We present a model for the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore systems to address this question. In this model, herbivores have a positive indirect effect on plants through recycling of a limiting nutrient. Plants can evolve but are constrained by a trade-off between growth and antiherbivore defense. Although evolution generally does not lead to optimal plant performance, our evolutionary analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the plant-herbivore interaction can be considered mutualistic. This requires in particular that herbivores efficiently recycle nutrients and that plant reproduction be positively correlated with primary production. We emphasize that two different definitions of mutualism need to be distinguished. A first ecological definition of mutualism is based on the short-term response of plants to herbivore removal, whereas a second evolutionary definition rests on the long-term response of plants to herbivore removal, allowing plants to adapt to the absence of herbivores. The conditions for an evolutionary mutualism are more stringent than those for an ecological mutualism. A particularly counterintuitive result is that higher herbivore recycling efficiency results both in increased plant benefits and in the evolution of increased plant defense. Thus, antagonistic evolution occurs within a mutualistic interaction.},

Chimpanzee feeding habitats, movement, group size and food eaten were assessed using focal and scan sampling. It was found that fruits were scarce during the dry season, when chimpanzees appeared and moved in large groups over long distances and raided farms at the forest edge. Chimpanzee movement out of the forest to forage was influenced by seasonal fluctuations in availability of preferred foods as some cultivated crops are perennial. Presence of chimpanzees in a specific feeding habitat was related to the availability of edible fruits both within and between months, suggesting that the presence of food may influence chimpanzee movement patterns. Therefore, a good understanding of patterns of frugivory is essential for making informed decisions about conservation of chimpanzees and other frugivores like birds and monkeys in Budongo as different forest habitats are under varying human pressure because of logging and other forms of utilization.},

abstract = {Many plants interact with groups of mutualist pollinators and seed dispersers. A key issue for both basic ecology and conservation is whether the different species within these guilds of mutualist animals are functionally equivalent. Comparing the relative effects of sympatric mutualists is important for understanding the evolution of multispecies mutualisms and for predicting mutualism stability in the face of anthropogenic change. However, empirical comparisons of the population-level impacts of mutualist animals on their host plant are rare, particularly for seed dispersal mutualisms in species-rich ecosystems. We compared the influence of three seed-dispersing tropical mammals, lar gibbons (Hylobates lar), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and red muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak), on the demography of a shared host tree in Thailand, Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae). Sambar and muntjac dispersed far more C. axillaris seeds than did gibbons. While sambar deposited many seeds under female tree canopies, muntjac were the only disperser to move seeds to open microhabitats, where C. axillaris seed germination, seedling survival, and initial growth are enhanced. Using stage-based population models, we assessed how disperser-specific seed dispersal, variation in the frequency of canopy gap formation, and their interaction influenced the potential population growth of C. axillaris. Large differences in dispersal quantity and small differences in dispersal quality among sambar and gibbons resulted in similar and negligible impacts on the tree's population dynamics. Muntjac, by taking some of the seeds to open microhabitats, are projected to have a greater positive impact on C. axillaris demography than either sambar or gibbons. Model comparisons of population-level species impacts may allow us to predict which ecological interactions are at risk from loss of critical species.},

Fruit seem highly suited to frugivore interactions with large ground-dwelling avian or marsupial frugivores, a role primarily filled by the endangered cassowary. We found that fruits had chemical defence traits that closely paralleled morphological ripening signals. Young fruit seeds had amongst the highest concentrations of plant tissue cyanogens ever recorded (some in excess of 12 mg g(-1) dw), yet the flesh of ripe fruits had negligible cyanogen defence. A seed treatment trial found that cassowary gut passage significantly improved germination from 4{\%} to 92{\%}, and we were not able to replicate this result with simulated treatments. While high levels of fruit fly larval infestation accounted for reduced seed viability, this predation was apparently reduced by cassowary gut passage. Post-germination seedling traits such as haustorial cryptocotylar cotyledons and epigeal germination may increase the chance of survival for establishing seedlings. We conclude that the range of traits seen in Ryparosa recruitment is particularly suited to interactions with frugivores and survival in a rainforest ecosystem.},

abstract = {We know a great deal about the plastic responses of plant phenotypes to the abiotic and biotic environment, but very little about the consequences of phenotypic plasticity for plant communities. In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints, new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity.},

abstract = {This review discusses the prevalence and potential for interactive effects between herbivory and competition on plant growth and biomass. and it is apparent that such effects typically arise when there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of herbivore behaviour (food or patch choice) and the spatial heterogeneity of the plant community. Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence of a biased choice of study systems. where studies using the first approach have primarily Studied mammalian herbivory while studies using the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory. Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very small-scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of removal experiments.},

We present a theoretical framework largely based on Bradshaw's principles of phenotypic plasticity (Adv. Gen. 13: 115) updated to account for recent developments in physiology and genetics. Against this framework we discuss associations between plasticity of yield and plasticity of phenological development. Plasticity was quantified using linear models of phenotype vs environment for 169 wheat lines grown in 6 environments in Mexico, 32 sunflower hybrids grown in at least 15 environments in Argentina and 7 grapevine varieties grown in at least 14 environments in Australia. In wheat, yield ranged from 0.6 to 7.8 t ha-1 and the range of plasticity was 0.74-1.27 for yield and 0.85-1.17 for time to anthesis. The duration of the post-anthesis period as a fraction of the season was the trait with the largest range of plasticity, i.e. 0.47-1.80. High yield plasticity was an undesirable trait as it was associated with low yield in low-yielding environments. Low yield plasticity and high yield in low-yielding environments were associated with three phenological traits: early anthesis, long duration and low plasticity of post-anthesis development. In sunflower, yield ranged from 0.5 to 4.9 t ha-1 and the range of plasticity was 0.72-1.29 for yield and 0.72-1.22 for time to anthesis. High yield plasticity was a desirable trait as it was primarily associated with high yield in high-yielding environments. High yield plasticity and high yield in high-yielding environments were associated with two phenological traits: late anthesis and high plasticity of time to anthesis. In grapevine, yield ranged from 1.2 to 18.7 t ha-1 and the range of plasticity was 0.79-1.29 for yield, 0.86-1.30 for time of budburst, 0.84-1.18 for flowering, and 0.78-1.16 for veraison. High plasticity of yield was a desirable trait as it was primarily associated with high yield in high-yielding environments. High yield plasticity was associated with two phenological traits: plasticity of budburst and plasticity of anthesis. We report for the first time positive associations between plasticities of yield and phenology in crop species. It is concluded that in addition to phenology per se (i.e. mean time to a phenostage), plasticity of phenological development merits consideration as a distinct trait influencing crop adaptation and yield. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The 450 million-year-old symbiosis between the majority of land plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most ancient, abundant, and ecologically important mutualisms on Earth. Yet, the evolutionary stability of mycorrhizal associations is still poorly understood, as it follows none of the constraints thought to stabilize cooperation in other well-known mutualisms. The capacity of both host and symbiont to simultaneously interact with several partners introduces a unique dilemma; detecting and punishing those exploiting the mutualism becomes increasingly difficult if these individuals can continue to access resources from alternative sources. Here, we explore four hypotheses to explain evolutionary cooperation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis: (1) pseudo-vertical transmission and spatial structuring of plant and fungal populations leading to local adaptation of partners; (2) luxury resource exchange in which plants trade surplus carbon for excess fungal nutrients; (3) partner choice allowing partners to associate with better cooperators; and (4) host and symbiont sanctions which actively reward good partners and punish less cooperative ones. We propose that mycorrhizal cooperation is promoted by an exchange of surplus resources between partners and enforced through sanctions by one or both partners. These mechanisms may allow plant and fungal genotypes to discriminate against individuals employing exploitative strategies, promoting patterns of partner choice. Together these selection pressures provide a framework for understanding the stabilization of mycorrhizal cooperation over evolutionary time.},

abstract = {In a given area, plant - animal mutualistic interactions form complex networks that often display nestedness, a particular type of asymmetry in interactions. Simple ecological and evolutionary factors have been hypothesized to lead to nested networks. Therefore, nestedness is expected to occur in other types of mutualisms as well. We tested the above prediction with the network structure of interactions in cleaning symbiosis at three reef assemblages. In this type of interaction, shrimps and fishes forage on ectoparasites and injured tissues from the body surface of fish species. Cleaning networks show strong patterns of nestedness. In fact, after controlling for species richness, cleaning networks are even more nested than plant - animal mutualisms. Our results support the notion that mutualisms evolve to a predictable community-level structure, be it in terrestrial or marine communities.},

Using physical evidence left by poachers and interviews with forest guards, we quantified poaching intensity for eight forest sites. We quantified mammal abundance using transect counts and small-mammal traps Abundance was inversely related to poaching intensity for 9 of 11 mammal species (significantly so for 5 species), confirming the first component of the hypothesis. The outcome of interactions among seeds, mammals, and beetles also varied with Poaching intensity: Nonvolant mammals were the only seed-dispersal agents, and rodents and beetles were the only seed predators. We quantified seed fate by examining the stony, endocarps that encase the seeds of both palms. The large, durable endocarps were located easily on the forest floor and bear characteristic scars when a rodent or beetle eats the enclosed seed The proportion of seeds dispersed away from beneath fruiting conspecifics;was inversely related to poaching intensity, ranging from 0{\%} to 10{\%} at protected sites where mammals were abundant and from 3{\%} to 40{\%} at unprotected sites where poachers were most active. The proportion of dispersed seeds destroyed by beetles was directly related to poaching intensity, ranging from 85{\%} to 99{\%} at protected sites and from 30{\%} to 50{\%} at unprotected sites. The proportion of dispersed seeds destroyed by rodents was inversely related to poaching intensity, ranging from 85{\%} to 99{\%} at protected sites and from 4{\%} to 50{\%} at at unprotected sites. Finally, seedling densities were directly related to poaching intensity. There was no single relationship between poaching intensity and the biotic interactions that determine seedling recruitment. The net effect of poaching on seedling recruitment can be determined only empirically. For these palms, seedling densities were directly, related to poaching intensity.},

abstract = {Given that a plant's defensive strategy against herbivory is never likely to be a single trait, we develop the concept of plant defense syndromes, where association with specific ecological interactions can result in convergence on suites of covarying defensive traits. Defense syndromes can be studied within communities of diverse plant species as well as within clades of closely related species. In either case, theory predicts that plant defense traits can consistently covary across species, due to shared evolutionary ancestry or due to adaptive convergence.We examined potential defense syndromes in 24 species of milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) in a field experiment. Employing phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found few correlations between seven defensive traits, no bivariate trade-offs, and notable positive correlations between trichome density and latex production, and between C:N ratio and leaf toughness. We then used a hierarchical cluster analysis to produce a phenogram of defense trait similarity among the 24 species. This analysis revealed three distinct clusters of species. The defense syndromes of these species clusters are associated with either low nutritional quality or a balance of higher nutritional quality coupled with physical or chemical defenses. The phenogram based on defense traits was not congruent, however, with a molecular phylogeny of the group, suggesting convergence on defense syndromes. Finally, we examined the performance of monarch butterfly caterpillars on the 24 milkweed species in the field; monarch growth and survival did not differ on plants in the three syndromes, although multiple regression revealed that leaf trichomes and toughness significantly reduced caterpillar growth. The discovery of convergent plant defense syndromes can be used as a framework to ask questions about how abiotic environments, communities of herbivores, and biogeography are associated with particular defense strategies of plants.},

Specifically, disruptions to pollination and seed-dispersal mutualistic interactions are often documented, although the profound implications of such impacts are not widely recognized. Such disruptions can occur via the introduction of alien pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores, predators or plants, and we define here the many potential outcomes of each situation. The frequency and circumstances under which each category of mechanisms operates are also poorly known. Most evidence is from population-level studies, and the implications for global biodiversity are difficult to predict.

abstract = {In pollination mutualisms, new resource patches are constantly being created as new flowering species come into bloom. These patch dynamics can have effects on the organization of multispecies pollination guilds, depending on the temporal and spatial variation of floral resources. The goal of this work was to investigate the temporal dynamics of the flower use by a hummingbird community in a highland temperate forest in central Mexico. The system was studied in terms of the seasonal changes in (1) specific composition and abundance of hummingbirds and their plants, (2) use of floral resources, and (3) nectar characteristics of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Eight plant species were visited by hummingbirds. These species differed in nectar and sugar characteristics and flowering intensity throughout the year. The highest floral abundance was recorded from May to October. Three plant species showed blooming peaks in this period; these species, Salvia elegans, Bouvardia ternifolia, and Penstemon roseus, were the most abundant and most visited flowering species over the year. Eight species of hummingbirds were recorded: two resident hummingbirds, three altitudinal migrants, and three winter visitors. Hummingbirds showed seasonal preferences and changes in foraging behaviour with respect to visitation rates and the use of floral resources among habitats. This work suggests that the availability and quality of resources can explain the temporal and spatial composition of the hummingbird community on a local scale.},

We performed seed addition experiments to assess seed limitation for 32 shade-tolerant tropical forest species and monitored the natural seed rain of 25 of these species for 17 years. 2 One, two or five seeds were sown into 0.0079-m(2) plots for large- (n = 5 species), medium- (n = 5) and small-seeded species (n = 22), respectively. The experiment was replicated at 69 sites, placed in groups of three at 23 locations. Seedling establishment was evaluated after 1 and 2 years in paired seed addition and control plots. Natural seedling emergence and understorey plant density were also measured. 3 Median natural seed rain was 0.31 seeds m(-2) year(-1) per focal species. 4 Seed addition enhanced seedling establishment in 31 and 26 of the 32 species after 1 and 2 years, respectively. Mean number of focal species' seedlings after 2 years was 0.002 seedlings in control plots and 0.12, 0.37 and 0.60 seedlings in seed addition plots for large-, medium- and small-seeded species, respectively. 5 A 25 seeds added treatment increased seedling establishment by {\textgreater}= 2.0-fold over the five seeds added treatment after 2 years. 6 Community-wide recruitment and understorey plant density were strongly seed-limited. The natural density of understorey plants averaged 12 plants m(-2) and was significantly less than for seedlings of the single focal species in plots with {\textgreater}= 2 seeds added 2 years earlier. 7 The number of established seedlings per seed added was independent of seed size. 8 Treatment (adding zero or five seeds), species identity and location all affected seedling establishment for the 11 small-seeded species represented at all sites, with treatment and its interactions accounting for 86{\%} of the explained variation. 9 Our results suggest that seed limitation plays a dominant role in seedling recruitment and understorey plant community assembly in tropical forests. Although strong seed limitation may set the stage for species-neutral community assembly, the species differences in seedling establishment rate and its spatial variation demonstrate an important role for species-specific processes.},

abstract = {Investigations seeking to understand the relationship between mandibular form, function, and dietary behavior have focused on the mandibular corpus and symphysis. African apes vary along a gradient of folivory/frugivory, yet few studies have evaluated the morphology of the mandibular corpus and symphysis in these taxa, and the investigations have yielded mixed results. Specifically, studies using external metrics have identified differences in mandibular proportions that analysis of cortical bone distribution has not substantiated. I contribute to the ongoing debate on the relationship between jaw form and dietary behavior by comparing mandibular corporal and symphyseal shapes in African apes. Importantly, and in contrast to previous studies of African ape internal geometry, I include the Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), the ape most specialized toward a folivorous diet. I test the hypotheses that 1) Gorilla beringei beringei always has significantly more robust mandibular corpora and symphyses, relative to mandibular length, than all other African apes and 2) all gorillas have significantly more robust mandibular corpora and symphyses, relative to mandibular length, than Pan. Results demonstrate that the folivorous mountain gorillas consistently exhibit a relatively wider mandibular symphysis and corpus than all other African apes. Furthermore, all gorillas consistently exhibit relatively more robust mandibular corporal and symphyseal dimensions than Pan. The results indicate that among African apes, mountain gorillas are better able to counter lateral transverse bending (wishboning) loads at the symphysis and torsional loads at the corpus. All gorillas are likewise better able to resist wishboning and vertical bending at the symphysis, and sagittal bending and torsion at the corpus, than Pan, findings that are consistent with masticating relatively tougher foods, repetitive loading of the jaws, or both. I offer possible explanations for the lack of concordance in results between studies that have analyzed the biomechanical properties of African ape mandibles and others that have relied on external metrics. More comprehensive study of the internal geometry of the mandible is needed to resolve whether African apes differ morphologically in ways predicted by dietary variation.},

Based on direct observations of mode of pollination in 88 species, we show that mode of pollination can confidently be predicted from fig traits only (anther-to-ovule ratio! or from wasp traits only (presence of coral combs). The presence of pollen pockets is not a predictor of mode of pollination. Data, direct and indirect, on 142 species, demonstrate numerous cases of the loss of active pollination and suggest one or few origins of active pollination. Hence, active pollination, an impressive example of the sophisticated traits that ma) result fi om mutualistic coevolution, depends on selective forces that can be overcome in some species, allowing reversions. Despite frequent loss, active pollination remains the predominant mode of pollination in Ficus.},

However, in the case of the dwarf palm (Chamaerops humilis) and its species-specific pollinating weevil (Derelomus chamaeropsis), rewards and advertisements are spatially separated. Flowers provide their specific pollinators with food and sites for both egg laying and larval development, but do not advertise them with floral odours or visually conspicuous petals. Insect behavioural bioassays revealed that pollinators are attracted by scents emitted by the leaves, which provide no rewards. These scents are released by large structures located at the sinuses of the palmate leaf. Such scent-releasing structures have not been previously reported on palm leaves, and we suggest that they may represent an 'exaptation' (pre-existing trait that acquired new functions). We also propose that such functional crossovers between vegetative and reproductive domains may be more frequent in plants than is currently documented.},

Here I argue that common methods of conserving and restoring tallgrass prairie have a weak scientific rationale, are not consistent with plausible history, and threaten prairie biodiversity. Dormant-season burns and grazer exclusion are human interventions that may promote artificially consistent dominance of large grasses utilizing the C4 photosynthetic pathway, thereby relegating hundreds of other prairie plants to small populations that are vulnerable to local extinction. I recommend an experimental approach to large remnant conservation and restoration in which varied conditions alter dominance, thereby increasing short-term species richness. I also recommend prescribed burning during the summer, to simulate the timing of lightning fire, and light-to-moderate grazing by different ungulates, to simulate historical grazing history. Both should favor plants that are consistently infrequent or rare in many managed prairies. Varied regimes of burn season, burn interval, and large-mammal grazing should promote greater overall species diversity and should more realistically represent varied conditions under which grassland taxa evolved.},

In a degraded grassland, we increased environmental variability by manipulating competition and herbivory along gradients of fertility and disturbance, and we circumvented dispersal barriers by adding 1.2 million seeds of five functionally distinct species at varying densities. The experiment ended after 12 weeks due to the direct and indirect effects of unapparent small native herbivores, which were barriers to population establishment by the added species. The direct cause of recruitment failure was browsing. The indirect cause was associated with competition from invasive plants that appeared to be more tolerant or resistant to herbivory. Variability in fertility, disturbance, propagule pressure, and competition had relatively minor impacts on colonization by the added species because herbivores controlled recruitment in most environments. Recruitment outside the herbivore exclosures was mostly by unpalatable exotics, suggesting a possible link between invasion success and herbivore resistance for some introduced plants.},

Within 6 days, up to 25{\%} of the nitrogen ingested by the ants was incorporated by the plants. 5 However, ant distribution within P. fimbriulatum plants did not correlate with the intra-plant uptake pattern of (15) N, and ant-mediated nitrogen uptake by myrmecophytic P. fimbriulatum accounted for less than 1{\%} of the plants' above-ground nitrogen demand.},

Only O. nigripes showed differences in relation to seed-size categories, consuming a high proportion of 'small' (diameter {\textless}= 2.5 mm) vs 'large' seeds. The rodents may be involved in seed dispersion of three plant species, by defecation of viable seeds of two Leandra (Melastomataceae) species and also by removing the pulp of Myrceugenia miersiana (Myrtaceae) fruits without swallowing or damaging their relatively large seeds, thus, potentially increasing germination rates of M. miersiana. Diet analyses indicated no significant difference among proportions of seed/fruit in the fecal samples of the three species of rodents (33 to 41{\%} of plant material).

abstract = {Obligate pollination mutualisms have been central to our understanding of the ecology and evolution of mutualisms. Although usually viewed as pairwise interactions, obligate mutualists also interact with other community members that may impact the mutualism. In this study, we examined the community context of the obligate inutualism between the plant Yucca filamentosa and its yucca moth pollinator Tegeticula cassandra to determine the relationships among plant traits, the community assemblage, and fruit set. In addition to attracting its pollinator, Y. filamentosa in central Florida also attracts two insect florivores: the hemipteran Leptoglossus phyllopus and the beetle Hymenorus densus. We Surveyed flowering Y. filamentosa in 2001 and 2002 to determine the abundance of the three insect species throughout the flowering period. We also measured fruit set and four plant traits thought to be important in attracting the moth pollinator. Path analysis revealed that T. cassandra was the most important determinant of relative fruit set for both years. Peak pollinator abundance was significantly earlier than peak flowering. Consequently, we found a negative relationship between plant flowering date and pollinator abundance. Furthermore. taller plants also attracted more pollinators. Leptoglossus phyllopus had a significantly negative impact on relative fruit set in 2001 but not in 2002, whereas H. densus had no effect in either year. Abundance of the two florivores was more closely tied to peak flowering of Y. filamentosa than was the peak abundance of the pollinator moths. Although both florivore species reached high densities on Y. filamentosa, their effect on relative fruit set through floral abscission may be partially masked by the characteristically high abscission rates found in yuccas. As a result, florivores may be feeding on flowers that are already destined to be abscised. Similarly, pollinator moths may be preadapted to handle the effects of florivores because females lay eggs across multiple plants and flowers. Hence, the obligate mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths may be somewhat buffered from the effects of local community members depending on whether florivores substantially increase floral abscission rates from year to year.},

The study of pollination biology of obligate outcrossers with wide altitudinal range may provide clues on how plants can remain reproductively successful in increasingly hostile environments without resorting to selfing. I studied the phenology, pollinator assemblages, breeding system and maternal success of the perennial entomophile outcrosser, Discaria nana, across a 1200- m elevation span in the Andes of Mendoza and Neuquen, Argentina (34degrees-37degreesS). D. nana behaved as self-incompatible throughout the studied gradient. At the higher site proportionally fewer flowers were pollinated, stigmatic loads were smaller and number of visitor species was lower than at low altitude; however, natural fruit set was 3.6 times higher and seed set 3.3 times higher. As a non-exclusive explanation, it is proposed that increased maternal success reflected better pollination quality at the higher site, to which several factors seemed to contribute. At higher altitude D. nana a) exhibited mutualisms with a high proportion of the available pollen vectors, b) had a higher rate of specialized pollinators (Lepidoptera, obligate nectar feeders) to unspecialized ones (Diptera, pollen and mixed feeders) in the visitor assemblage which would reduce ineffective (i.e. self) pollination because nectar feeders visited both male and female phase flowers and pollen feeders favoured male phase flowers, c) had an extended floral longevity (especially the female phase), and d) showed an increased floral display (as number of flowers per unit plant area). Differential rewarding through more concentrated nectar may explain the change in assemblage composition. The flowers' reverse herkogamy (i.e. the location of the stigma below the anthers) seemed to enhance the beneficial effects of the abundance of more effective pollinators.},

abstract = {Plant/seed-eater pollinators mutualisms involve a plant pollinated by an insect whose larvae develop by eating a fraction of host-plant seeds. The outcome of the interaction therefore depends on the number of ovules fertilized by adult visits and the number of seeds destroyed by larvae. Among the very few cases of such mutualisms reported so far is the globeflower-globeflower flies mutualism, which is unique in that it involves several congeneric fly species (Chiastocheta genus) coexisting within a single host-plant species, Trollius europaeus. These species exhibit contrasted oviposition behaviors resulting in a more or less beneficial outcome for the plant. We designed an adaptive dynamics model to investigate how morphological traits of globeflower could affect the evolution of oviposition in its pollinating flies. Three fly traits (flower age at oviposition, clutch size and the level of avoidance of already parasitized flowers) and one plant trait (closed or open corolla) were examined. Whatever the shape of the flower, evolutionary branching occurs between early and late ovipositing flies, driven by strong competition among larvae within a fruit. Once this branching occurred, the closed shape of the corolla is likely to offer a better protection to eggs of early but not of late ovipositing flies. The difference in egg survival results in higher competition among early larvae and thus selects for decreased clutch size in early flies. This can be seen as a first step in the evolution of a mutualistic behavior. The prediction of our model fits field observations of fly behavior, giving theoretical support to the hypothesis of fly sympatric speciation within its host plant. Moreover, flower closed globe shape can be positively selected in globeflowers as it results in a reduction of parasitism strength. This last evolution therefore leads to a stable mutualism between globeflowers and globeflower flies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

They constructed a statistical model of the effect of herbivory on plant fitness, including damage level and an environmental factor as the independent factors, in which tolerance is defined as a slope of the regression line when damage level is regressed with plant fitness. They claim that while experiments with imposed damage are more accurate (i.e., they give a more correct estimate of tolerance), experiments with natural damage are more precise under a wide range of parameter values (i.e., tolerance estimates explain a larger part of variation in fitness). I show, however, that experiments with imposed damage are less precise only when an experimenter uses an experimental design that has weaker statistical power than in experiments with natural herbivory. The experimenter can nevertheless control the damage levels to optimize the experimental designs. For instance, when half of the experimental plants are left undamaged and the other half treated with maximal relevant damage level, experiments with imposed damage are almost always much more precise than experiments with natural damage.},

abstract = {Plants engage in multiple, simultaneous interactions with other species; some ( enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant performance. Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant - enemy and plant - mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of ( negative) enemy effects was greater than that of ( positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists ( bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse ( but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non-crop plants ( suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among studies.},

abstract = {Plant community structure is often the result of interactions between succession, disturbance, and dispersal. While some disturbances may be highly stochastic (e.g., flooding or landslides), other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community (e.g., fire or herbivory). For example, when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial-scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape. may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species. This structuring of the landscape occurs even though we assume that the entire landscape is intrinsically identical.},

The relatively conserved chloroplast gene coding rbCl allowed the estimation of the taxonomic position of Ficus relative to other genera within the Moraceae. Further, in conjunction with chloroplast tRNA spacer genes, rbcL sequences allowed the partial resolution of the phylogenetic associations of fig species from different parts of the world with representatives from all the recognized subgenera of Fiats. The phylogeny of the corresponding wasp species that pollinate most of those taxa was estimated using mitochondrial COI-COII and 12S ribosomal genes. At a fine scale, the phylogenies of species within two subgenera of figs growing in Panama (Urostigma, and Pharmacosycea) were estimated by using protein electrophoretic data. The phylogeny of the corresponding pollinator wasp species was estimated using COII sequence data. Although we need to extend the taxa sampled and augment the molecular database, the host and pollinator phylogenies show a high degree of congruence and the results support the predominance of strict-sense coevolution between figs and their pollinator wasps at both global and fine scales. },

abstract = {The maned wolf Chrysocyon brachyurus is the largest canid inhabiting South America. Its geographic distribution includes the open fields of Brazil's central area, which is currently undergoing agricultural expansion. The diet of the maned wolf and its seasonal variation was determined on a dairy cattle ranch (Sao Luis farm, 566 ha) in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. From January to December faeces of the maned wolf were collected monthly (n = 150 scats; 397 food item occurrences). Twenty-nine taxa were identified from scats, 18 of animal origin (46{\%} or 183 occurrences) and 11 of plants (54{\%} or 214 occurrences). The fruits of Solanum lycocarpum were the dominant food item in our study (29{\%}). Mammals contributed 13{\%}, arthropods 12{\%}, birds 11{\%} and reptiles 2{\%} of the food items. Arthropods and fruits were prevalent in the rainy season and mammals in the dry season. As expected for a heavily fanned region, frugivory results were at the lower end of the diversity scale (9-33 species) and included four old garden species. No previous study of the diet of maned wolf has registered as many species of Solanaceae as this one. Although dietary richness was lower, the main food items (wolf fruit, armadillos, rodents, birds) were the same as study sites in 'cerrado' and upland meadows. In this region, the open habitats occupied by the maned wolf were previously covered by Atlantic forest, suggesting that landscape modification such as cattle ranching has opened new frontiers for distribution expansion of the maned wolf. The impact of loss of dietary richness and the increase in Solanaceae on the survival of the maned wolf need to be evaluated.},

abstract = {Describing the relative magnitude and controls of herbivory and decomposition is important in understanding the trophic transference, recycling, and storage of carbon and nutrients in diverse ecosystems. We examine the variability in herbivory and decomposition between and within a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We also analyze how that variability is associated with differences in net primary production and producer nutritional quality. Net primary production and producer nutritional quality are uncorrelated between the two types of, system or within either type. Producer nutritional quality is correlated to the percentage of primary production consumed by herbivores or percentage of detrital production decomposed annually, regardless of whether the comparison is made between the two types of systems or within either type of system. Thus, producer nutritional quality stands out as a consistent indicator of the importance of consumers as top-down controls of producer biomass and detritus accumulation and nutrient recycling. However, absolute consumption by herbivores and absolute decomposition (both in g C.m(-2.)yr(-1)) are often associated with absolute primary production and independent of producer nutritional quality, because the variability in net primary production across systems largely exceeds that in the percentage consumed or decomposed. Thus, primary production often stands out as an indicator of the absolute flux of producer carbon transferred to consumers and of the potential levels of secondary production maintained in the system. These patterns contribute to our understanding of the variability and control of herbivory and decomposition, and implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, in view of their robustness, they may offer a template for global change models seeking to predict anthropogenic effects on carbon and nutrient fluxes.},

abstract = {1. I present a model of mutualistic interactions in a patchy landscape. The interaction is between two species that differ in their mobility. The landscape is spatially structured, with several localities interconnected by dispersal of the mobile mutualist.2. Within a given locality, an Allee effect can occur such that the per capita growth rate of the non-mobile mutualist declines with its own abundance. The Allee effect arises in response to low abundances of the mobile mutualist, and causes extinction of both species once their numbers fall below a critical threshold.3. Dispersal of the mobile mutualist can rescue such sink communities from extinction, provided there is at least one source community in which both species have abundances above the extinction threshold. Dispersal itself is density-independent, but induces negative density-dependence that counteracts the positive density-dependence due to the Allee effect. This negative feedback effect of dispersal has not previously been demonstrated in mutualism models.4. Rescue of sink communities, however, depends on how dispersal influences the local dynamics of source communities. If dispersal involves surplus individuals the loss of whom does not affect the reproductive output of the source community, persistence of sink communities is guaranteed as long as the survivorship of long-distance dispersers exceeds a lower threshold. In contrast, if dispersal involves emigrants that constitute a fraction of the source community's reproductive output, persistence of sink communities additionally requires that emigration does not exceed an upper threshold. Too much emigration can cause a net loss of the mobile mutualist from the source community, resulting in landscape-wide extinction of the mutualistic interaction.5. The effect of dispersal mode on the dynamics of mutualistic interactions has not been appreciated previously. If the benefit of the rescue effect to sinks is outweighed by the cost of dispersal to sources, mutualistic communities linked by dispersal may experience a greater loss of diversity than communities that are isolated.},

Here we present a general model that predicts three key factors will be important in mutualism evolution: (i) high benefit to cost ratio, (ii) high within-species relatedness and (iii) high between-species fidelity. These factors operate by moderating three types of feedback benefit from mutualism: cooperator association, partner-fidelity feedback and partner choice. in defining the relationship between these processes, our model also allows an assessment of their relative importance. Importantly, the model suggests that phenotypic feedbacks (partner-fidelity feedback, partner choice) are a more important explanation for between-species cooperation than the development of genetic correlations among species (cooperator association). We explain the relationship of our model to existing theories and discuss the empirical evidence for our predictions.},

Over two burn cycles at 3-yr intervals, cover increased in the rhizomatous perennials Andropogon geuardii, Aster simplex and Solidago altissima in plots burned in spring, or summer, or left unburned, but cover showed dramatic positive or negative responses to spring or summer burns in Agropyron repens, Erigeron annuus, Panicum virgatum, Phalaris arundinacea, and Rudbeckia hirta. Aggregate response of flowering guilds was stronger. By the last (1993) census, the phenological guild flowering before mid-July (summed cover values for nine species) accounted for 4{\%} cover in unburned plots and {\textless}2{\%} cover in plots burned in early spring, but 32{\%} cover in plots burned in midsummer. The late-flowering guild (summed values for 21 species) accounted for 93{\%} cover in unburned plots anti 97{\%} cover in plots burned in early spring, but 66{\%} cover in plots burned in midsummer. Remaining space was taken by a mid-season guild(li species), only one of which (E. annuus) was common enough for individual statistical analysis, These results have implications for succession of prairie vegetation under different seasonal fire regimes. Over 8 yr, summer fires that simulated the timing of lightning fires retarded progression to dominance of large, late-flowering C-4 grasses, allowing early-flowering species eliminated in other treatments to persist or even prosper. Primaeval lightning fires in midsummer may have produced quite different communities than anthropogenic fires, which are rarely set during the middle of the growing season.},

abstract = {North American prairie remnants and restorations are normally managed with dormant-season prescribed fires. Growing-season fire is of interest because it suppresses dominant late-flowering grasses and forbs, thereby making available light and other resources used by subdominant grasses and forbs that comprise most prairie diversity. Here we report a twofold increase in mean frequency and richness of subdominant species after late-summer fire. Stimulation of subdominants was indiscriminate; richness of prairie and volunteer species increased in species that flowered in early, mid-, or late season. Early spring fire, the management tool used on this site until this experiment, had no effect on subdominant richness or frequency. Neither burn treatment affected reproductive tillering of the tallgrasses Sorghastrum nutans or Panicum virgatum. Flowering of Andropogon gerardii increased 4-fold after early-spring fires and 11-fold after late-summer fires. These preliminary results suggest that frequency and species richness of subdominants can be improved by late growing-season fire without compromising vigor of warm-season tallgrasses.},

abstract = {1. Stable mutualistic interactions require the long-term alignment of fitness interests of participating species. This condition is fulfilled when the benefits of the relationship exceed the costs for all partners. 2. One apparent stabilizing factor in mutualisms is the vertical (parent to offspring) transmission of symbionts, as this tends to reduce the expression of virulent traits and reproductive conflicts. This study examines the cost and mode of transmission of a mutualistic Streptomyces bacterium that grows on the cuticle of leaf-cutting ants and produces antibiotics against a specialized fungal parasite of the ant fungus gardens. 3. It is shown that ant respiration rates are elevated by 10-20{\%} when the bacterium is present on their cuticle. This increase is due to direct respiration of the bacterium and possible excess respiration by the ants. Although these two factors cannot be separated, it is clear that the total increase gives a reasonable quantification of the metabolic costs incurred by the Streptomyces symbiont. 4. Ants that actively maintain Streptomyces cultures on their cuticle tend to consume more of their mutualistic fungus garden than controls and this excess consumption increases with the amount of Streptomyces bacteria present. 5. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the mutualistic bacterium is not present on major workers immediately following eclosion, indicating that the bacterium is not transferred to callow workers until later. 6. The results of an experiment simulating within-colony transmission to callow workers suggest that the bacterium is predominantly transmitted from older to newly eclosed major workers, but that transmission may also occur via the fungus garden. The presence of Streptomyces bacteria in the fungus garden implies that rare events of horizontal transmission of the fungal cultivar of attine ants may also imply horizontal transmission of strains of the mutualistic bacterium.},

We investigated the soil seed bank, and followed seedlings from emergence and establishment to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama.2 To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in a factorial design.3 Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots than in control plots.4 We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to the end of the first dry season.5 In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers.6 We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence-establishment success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily, a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed differences in light requirements among pioneer species.},

abstract = {Species interactions commonly coevolve as complex geographic mosaics of populations shaped by differences in local selection and gene flow. We use a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations ("hot spots") but not in others ("cold spots"). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow among populations.},

abstract = {1 The effects of natural variation in herbivory, local competition, plant size, and fruit production on next year's growth, survival and inflorescence production of individuals in natural populations of Calathea ovandensis were estimated during 5 years.2 For each year, we estimated path coefficients (by standardized multiple regression analysis) for the direct effects of predictor variables on demographic rates. Separate analyses were performed for each life-history stage: seedlings, juveniles, pre-reproductives and reproductives, for a total of 55 analyses. Emergent patterns for stages were evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining years. To determine significance of effects in single years, we calculated table-wide probabilities for each stage across multiple years (Bonferroni sequential test). Emergent patterns for years were also evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining stages.3 Survival of seedlings was positively affected by plant size and negatively affected by local competition. Survival of juveniles was positively affected by plant size, but not by other factors. Survival of large stages was not generally affected by any of the factors.4 Relative growth rates of all stages were negatively affected by plant size; larger plants grew more slowly than smaller plants. Additionally, growth rate of juveniles was negatively affected by local competition, whereas growth rate of reproductives was positively affected by reproduction.5 Next year's inflorescence production was positively affected by plant size for both pre-reproductive and reproductive stages. For reproductives, it was additionally positively affected by current fruit production.6 Analysis of differences among years showed that herbivory negatively affected both survival and growth in 1985, but not in other years, whereas local competition negatively affected survival in 1983 and growth in 1984.7 Effects of biotic interactions varied among stages and through time. The large effects of competition on seedlings and juveniles was as expected, but the small effect of herbivory on small plants was surprising as was the striking temporal variation in its effect and its impact on large plants.},

abstract = {We compared the effects of herbivory by grasshoppers and neighbourhood competition on two dominant grasses, Bromus erectus and Brachypodium pinnatian, in a calcareous grassland in the French Alps. In a fully factorial design, herbivory was reduced by insecticide spraying and competition was reduced by removal of neighbouring plants. The effects of herbivory and competition were species-dependent. Bromus, a stress-tolerant species, was strongly affected by competition, but not by herbivory. In contrast, the more competitive species, Brachypodium, was negatively affected by herbivory, but only when neighbouring vegetation was removed. The greatest herbivory pressure on isolated targets of Brachypodium is likely to be due to the indirect effects of experimental gaps, i.e. more favourable microclimatic and foraging conditions for grasshoppers. This suggests that herbivory by insects may be a confounding factor in many plant removal experiments. Field experiments designed to study the combined effects of competition and herbivory should take into account the indirect effects induced by experimental gaps.

abstract = {Because encrusting coralline algae rely on herbivory or low light levels to prevent being overgrown by competitively superior fleshy algae, corallines are relatively rare in shallow areas with low rates of herbivory. In contrast to this general trend, the branching coralline alga Neogoniolithon strictum occurs primarily in shallow seagrass beds and along the margins of shallow reef flats where herbivory on macrophytes is low. This alga apparently persists in these habitats by providing refuge to the herbivorous crab Mithrax sculptus al mean densities of 1 crab per 75 g of algal wet mass. When crabs were removed from some host corallines, hosts without crabs supported 9 times the epiphytic growth of hosts with crabs after only 30 days. Crabs without access to a coralline alga were rapidly consumed by reef fishes, while most of those tethered near a host alga survived. These results suggest that the crabs clean their algal host of fouling seaweeds and associate with the host to minimize predation. However, to effectively clean the host, the crab must consume the wide array of macroalgae that commonly co-occur with coralline algae in these habitats, including chemically defended species in the genera Halimeda, Dictyota, and Laurencia. Crabs did readily consume these seaweeds, which were avoided by, and are chemically defended from, herbivorous fishes. Even though crabs readily consumed both Halimeda, and Dictyota in whole-plant feeding assays, chemical extracts from these species significantly reduced crab feeding, suggesting that factors other than secondary chemistry (e.g., food value, protein, energy content), may determine whole-plant palatability. Having the ability to use a wide variety of foods, and choosing the most profitable rather than the least defended foods, would diminish foraging time, increase site fidelity, and allow the crab to function mutualistically with the host alga. Despite the obvious benefit of associating with N. strictum, M. sculptus did not prefer it over other habitats offering a structurally similar refuge, suggesting that these crabs are not N. strictum specialists, but rather occupy multiple habitats that provide protection from predators. Structurally complex organisms like N. strictum may commonly suppress competitors by harboring protective symbionts like M. sculptus. It is possible that diffuse coevolution has occurred between these two groups; however, this seems unlikely because both herbivore and host appear to respond most strongly to selective pressures from predators and competitors outside this association.},

abstract = {The idea of coevolution originated with Darwin's proposal that long-proboscid pollinators and long-tubed flowers might be engaged in reciprocal selection, but this has not been demonstrated. Here we test key aspects of Darwin's hypothesis of reciprocal selection in an experiment with naturally interacting populations of extremely long-proboscid flies (Moegistorhynchus longirostris: Nemestinidae) and long-tubed irises (Lapeirousia anceps: Iridaceae). We show that the benefit derived by both the fly (volume of nectar consumed) and the plant (number pollen grains received) depends on the relative length of their interacting organs. Each trait is shown to act both as agent and target in directional reciprocal selection, potentially leading to a race. This understanding of how fitness in both species varies in relation to the balance of their armament allows us to make tentative predictions about the nature of selection across multiple communities. We find that in each community a core group of long-tubed plant species might together be involved in diffuse coevolution with the fly. In poorly matched populations, the imbalance in armament is too great to allow reciprocal selection to act, and these species might instead experience one-sided selection that leads to convergence with the core species. Reciprocal selection drives the evolution of the community, then, additional species become attached o the network of interacting mutualists byt convergence.},

Lycium fruit remains (including seeds) were observed in 31.7{\%} of the lizard droppings and 50{\%} of the shrike pellets. 3 As would be expected for legitimate seed dispersers, external seed damage produced by each species was negligible. Lycium seeds were significantly matched with the presence of lizard remains in shrike pellets. Seeds in shrike pellets have come from fruit consumed by lizards that have been predated by the shrikes, and not directly from bird frugivory. 4 Seeds from shrike pellets showed significantly higher germination rates than those from uneaten fruits and lizard droppings. 5 It seems probable that different treatments in the guts of each species and retention time are two main factors influencing the germination process, While gut pass time in G. atlantica has been estimated to be 2.42 days on average, the retention time of a seed inside a shrike gizzard is much shorter (45-55 mill). 6 This is a new case of the scarcely known phenomenon of indirect seed dispersal, which seems to acquire a relatively important role in small islands where the animal plant interaction is very intense and all the elements of the system are native. },

Re-emergence increased with foundress density in figs and some foundresses oviposited in two male figs, indicating that they re-emerge because of oviposition site limitation. Re-emergence was independent of fig diameter, indicating that permeability is not because of fig age at entry. Rather, as some foundresses also pollinate two female figs we suggest permeability is selected for because it increases pollinator production and/or efficiency (although, potentially opposing these hypotheses, we also found between- tree differences in permeability in male figs). In addition, we show that re-emergence is much more common than previously suspected, and more common from gynodioecious than monoecious fig species.

abstract = {We present experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that increased spine length in acacia species is a defense induced by herbivory. Acacia drepanolobium is the dominant tree over large areas of East Africa. Each individual tree is occupied by one of four ant species at our study site. Using two types of electric fences, we have effectively controlled herbivory by megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes) and other large mammalian herbivores at a field site in Laikipia, Kenya since 1995. Mean spine lengths of new spines on trees occupied by the most abundant ant species (presumed to be a defensive mutualist) have shown a slow and steady decline over the first five years of the experiment on branches protected from these herbivores. This reduction has been 35-40{\%}, or approximately half of the reduction in spine length that we anticipate will eventually occur, based on trees that have been protected from herbivory for many years. In contrast, trees Occupied by a resident ant species that systematically prunes shoots have shown no reduction in spine length associated with herbivore exclusion treatments. Experimental pruning of shoots similar to that carried out by this ant species resulted in longer spines on seedlings in a greenhouse setting. Simulated large mammal browsing in the field rapidly (re-)induced greater spine lengths on trees that had been protected from large mammals for five years. The slow relaxation of spine length in the absence of herbivory, contrasted with its rapid induction after simulated browsing, suggests that there is a difference in the reliability of these two signals. Spine length responses to herbivory were extremely local (limited to individual branches). These branch-specific responses are consistent with the hypothesis that induced defense in this system evolved in the context of within-tree spatial variation in herbivore pressure, in particular variation in branch height.},

abstract = {Seed-dispersal mutualisms have a fundamental role in regenerating natural communities(1,2). Interest in the importance of seed dispersal to plant communities has been heightened by worldwide declines in animal dispersers(3-5). One view, the 'keystone mutualist hypothesis', predicts that these human-caused losses will trigger a cascade of linked extinctions throughout the community(6). Implicitly, this view holds that mutualisms, such as seed dispersal, are crucial ecological interactions that maintain the structure and diversity of natural communities. Although many studies suggest the importance of mutualism(3,7), empirical evidence for community-level impacts of mutualists has remained anecdotal(8,9), and the central role of mutualism, relative to other species interactions, has long been debated in the theoretical literature(10,11). Here I report the community-level consequences of a biological invasion that disrupts important seed-dispersal mutualisms. I show that invasion of South African shrublands by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) leads to a shift in composition of the plant community, owing to a disproportionate reduction in the densities of large-seeded plants. This study suggests that the preservation of mutualistic interactions may be essential for maintaining natural communities.},

abstract = {The obligate pollination mutualisin between yuccas (Agavaceae) and yucca moths (Lepidoptera, Prodoxidae), in which the adult moth pollinates yucca flowers and her progeny feed on developing seeds, is one of the classically cited examples of coevolution. While known since 1872, our understanding of the ecology and evolution of this association has increased dramatically in the past decade. Here I review current information on organismal diversity and phylogenetic relationships, ecological relationships, origin and reversal of the mutualism, and the potential for analyzing patterns of co-speciation and the historical role of coevolution on specific traits in driving diversification in the interaction. Major novel developments in recent years include the recognition of a large species complex of pollinators, previously thought to be one polyphagous species; a majority of all moth species are monophagous. Considerable life history diversity has been unveiled, and mechanisms that maintain a mutualistic equilibrium by preventing over-exploitation documented. Phylogenctic and ecological information, including data from other, newly discovered facultative pollinators in the Prodoxidae, have been used to erect a hypothesis for the evolution of obligate mutualism. Application of a molecular clock to phylogenetic data suggests that the plant-moth association arose at least 40 Mya, and that the obligate mutualisin evolved very quickly after this event. Two separate events of reversal of mutualism have been identified, involving derived "cheater" moth species that oviposit into fruits resulting from pollination by other pollinator species. This appears to have happened not through selection for cheating, but rather as a byproduct of a phenological shift to an unexploited seed resource, in which case pollination behavior became redundant. Analyses of parallel diversification and character coevolution are hampered by incomplete phylogenetic information at the species level, especially for the plants, but also for the pollinators. Available data indicate considerable deviation from strict co-speciation, and no evident examples of this process. Analyses of the role of coevolutionary processes in driving the diversification of yuccas and yucca moths will be possible once fully resolved phylogenies become available.},

We compared results of the response of plant secondary chemistry to changes in environmental conditions against two contrasting hypotheses: (1) the carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis (CNBH) and (2) the photoinhibition hypothesis. Nutrient and light levels affected relative growth rate and leaf area ratio of seedlings. Electron transport rates and optimum photochemical efficiencies indicated different rates of carbon fixation between treatments, consistent with levels of chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigments. Nonphotochernical quenching and xanthophylls per unit chlorophyll were negatively correlated with total chlorophyll content. Consistent with the photoinhibition hypothesis, levels of leaf phenolics (flavonols, hydrolyzable tannins, and sideroxylonals) per unit chlorophyll were also negatively correlated with. total chlorophyll content. In contrast, phenolic levels on a dry-mass basis were not consistent with predictions of the CNBH; they were better explained as A response to severity of photoinhibition than by reallocation of resources from growth to defense. Total essential oil and cineole levels were positively correlated with nitrogen levels, but there was an interaction in their response to nutrients and light. Thus, levels of essential oils were not well predicted by the CNBH. Sideroxylonal and cineole levels were not correlated, and we hypothesize that different processes and requirements drive their production. Intake of seedlings by possums and pademelons was not directly negatively correlated with levels of hydrolyzable tannins, sideroxylonals, or essential oils. An interaction of the costs of these compounds against benefits of nitrogen levels may explain patterns in intake. We suggest that, while environmentally induced levels of carbon-based plant secondary metabolites have consequences for herbivory, photoinhibition may drive the adjustment of levels of leaf phenolics in response to variation in light and nutrients. This contrasts with the view that these adjustments represent a trade-off in resource allocation between growth and defense.},

Although all individuals use the pollination services of yucca moths, many individuals do not reciprocate in sustaining yucca moth larvae. Cheating is associated with the morphology of Y. baccata pistils. In Y. baccata, the apex of the ovary contains only inviable ovules, and there are two distinct flower types, one of which has twice as many potentially viable ovules as the other. Because yucca moths oviposit at the apex of Y. baccata ovaries, larvae in flowers with few viable ovules fail to encounter viable ovules and therefore perish. Inflorescences generally have just one flower type, implying that some individuals cheat whereas others maintain the yucca moth population. Our most surprising observation, however, is that although the proportion of cheaters should be low, over 70{\%} of Y. baccata individuals cheat. Me hypothesize that both density- and frequency-dependent processes maintain a balance of cheaters and noncheaters in this system.},

However, development does not slow sufficiently to permit the wasps to remain within their sheltered larval habitat (the fig inflorescence) throughout winter, a season in which the short-lived adults have little chance of finding an oviposition site.

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait- mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change.},

abstract = {Many mutualisms host ``exploiter'' species that consume the benefits provided by one or both mutualists without reciprocating. Exploiters have been widely assumed to destabilize mutualisms, yet they are common. We develop models to explore conditions for local coexistence of obligate plant/pollinating seed parasite mutualisms and nonpollinating exploiters. As the larvae of both pollinators and (at a later time) exploiters consume seeds, we examine the importance of intraspecific and (asymmetric) interspecific competition among and between pollinators and exploiters for achieving three-way coexistence. With weak intra- and interspecific competition, exploiters can invade the stable mutualism and coexist with the mutualists (either stably or with oscillations), provided the exploiters' intrinsic birthrate (b(E)) slightly exceeds that of the pollinators. At higher b(E), all three species go locally extinct. When facing strong interspecific competition, exploiters cannot invade and coexist with the mutualists if intraspecific competition in pollinators and exploiters is weak. However, strong intraspecific competition in pollinators and exploiters facilitates exploiter invasion and coexistence and greatly expands the range of b(E) over which stable coexistence occurs. Our results suggest that mutualist/exploiter coexistence may be more easily achieved than previously thought, thus highlighting the need for a better understanding of competition among and between mutualists and exploiters.},

abstract = {Until the 1990s, herbivory on aquatic vascular plants was considered to be of minor importance, and the predominant view was that freshwater and marine macrophytes did not take part in the food web: their primary fate was the detritivorous pathway. In the last 25 years, a substantial body of evidence has developed that shows that herbivory is an important factor in the ecology of vascular macrophytes across freshwater and marine habitats. Herbivores remove on average 40–48{\%} of plant biomass in freshwater and marine ecosystems, which is typically 5–10 times greater than reported for terrestrial ecosystems. This may be explained by the lower C:N stoichiometry found in submerged plants. Herbivores affect plant abundance and species composition by grazing and bioturbation and therewith alter the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, including biogeochemical cycling, carbon stocks and primary production, transport of nutrients and propagules across ecosystem boundaries, habitat for other organisms and the level of shoreline protection by macrophyte beds. With ongoing global environmental change, herbivore impacts are predicted to increase. There are pressing needs to improve our management of undesirable herbivore impacts on macrophytes (e.g. leading to an ecosystem collapse), and the conflicts between people associated with the impacts of charismatic mega-herbivores. While simultaneously, the long-term future of maintaining both viable herbivore populations and plant beds should be addressed, as both belong in complete ecosystems and have co-evolved in these long before the increasing influence of man. Better integration of the freshwater, marine, and terrestrial herbivory literatures would greatly benefit future research efforts.},

abstract = {Human-induced fragmentation and disturbance of natural habitats can shift abundance and composition of frugivore assemblages, which may alter patterns of frugivory and seed dispersal. However, despite their relevance to the functioning of ecosystems, plant-frugivore interactions in fragmented areas have been to date poorly studied. I investigated spatial variation of avian frugivore assemblages and fruit removal by dispersers and predators from Mediterranean myrtle shrubs (Myrtus communis) in relation to the degree of fragmentation and habitat features of nine woodland patches (72 plants). The study was conducted within the chronically fragmented landscape of the Guadalquivir Valley (SW Spain), characterized by 1{\%} of woodland cover. Results showed that the abundance and composition of the disperser guild was not affected by fragmentation, habitat features or geographical location. However, individual species and groups of resident/migrant birds responded differently: whereas resident dispersers were more abundant in large patches, wintering dispersers were more abundant in fruit-rich patches. Predator abundances were similar between patches, although the guild composition shifted with fragmentation. The proportion of myrtle fruits consumed by dispersers and predators varied greatly between patches, but did not depend on bird abundances. The geographical location of patches determined the presence or absence of interactions between myrtles and seed predators (six predated and three non-predated patches), a fact that greatly influenced fruit dispersal success. Moreover, predation rates were lower (and dispersal rates higher) in large patches with fruit-poor heterospecific environments (i.e. dominated by myrtle). Predator satiation and a higher preference for heterospecific fruits by dispersers may explain these patterns. These results show that 1) the frugivore assemblage in warm Mediterranean lowlands is mostly composed of fragmentation-tolerant species that respond differently to landscape changes; and 2) that the feeding behaviour of both dispersers and predators influenced by local fruit availability may be of great importance for interpreting patterns of frugivory throughout the study area.},

Here we review conflicts of interests occurring in the 13 known nursery pollination systems, where pollinators reproduce within the inflorescence they pollinate. We found three main conflicts of interest between mutualists that correspond to the following evolutionary questions: 1) Why do plants not kill their pollinators' larvae? 2) Why do pollinators visit deceptive flowers? and 3) Why do pollinators pollinate? We show that the reproductive system of the plant is strongly correlated not only with the set of conflicts of interests that actually occur but also with the proximal resolution of these conflicts. In many cases the evolutionary stability of nursery pollination mutualisms relies on the avoidance of intra-specific competition among pollinator larvae. This stabilizing factor could perhaps also explain the absence of overexploitation in other mutualisms.},

We use spatial auto- and cross-correlation analyses to quantify spatial patterns of fruit abundance and avian frugivory across a 4-month period within a forested 4.05-ha study grid in Puerto Rico. Analyses focused on two tanager species, Spindalis portoricensis and Nesospingus speculiferus, and their principal food plants. Three broad questions are addressed: (1) at what spatial scales is fruit abundance and frugivory patchy; (2) at what spatial scales do frugivores respond to fruit abundance; and (3) to what extent do spatial patterns of frugivory overlap between bird species? Fruit patch size, species composition, and heterogeneity was variable among months, despite fruit patch locations remaining relatively consistent between months. Positive correlations between frugivory and fruit abundance suggested tanagers successfully tracked fruit abundance. Frugivory was, however, more localized than fruit abundance. Scales of spatial overlap in frugivory and monthly variation in the foraging locations of the two tanager species suggested that interspecific facilitation may have been important in determining bird foraging locations. In particular, S. portoricensis, a specialist frugivore, may have relied on the loud calls of the gregarious generalist, N. speculiferus, to find new foraging areas. Such a mechanism could help explain the formation of mixed species feeding flocks and highlights the potential importance of facilitation between species that share resources.},

abstract = {Mutualisms form an integral part of many communities and play an important role in the maintenance and promotion of biodiversity. The inherent conflict of interest between mutualists suggests that partners should reduce the cost of the interaction whenever possible. As a result, defense mechanisms may evolve to prevent overexploitation by both partners. Selection for the evolution of defenses intrinsic to the interaction may be unnecessary, however, under particular ecological conditions. I examined the interaction between the pollinating yucca moth Tegeticula cassandra and its host plant Yucca filamentosa to determine whether extrinsic factors are important in promoting stability in this mutualism. Yuccas can selectively abscise fruit with high egg loads for moth species that damage ovules during oviposition into the locule. Female T. cassandra, however, lay eggs less than a millimeter beneath the tissue surface and fail to damage ovules, circumventing this mechanism of selective abscission. Consequently, yuccas are unable to regulate egg loads by T. cassandra, and moths are free to lay many eggs. Despite this, only 5-11{\%} of T. cassandra eggs survive to exit the fruit as mature larvae. I tested the hypothesis that T. cassandra survivorship is regulated by the extrinsic factors dehydration and predation. While exclusion of potential predators seemed to have no effect on survivorship, moth eggs in flowers with experimentally increased vapor pressure had significantly greater survivorship compared to controls. Survivorship of a closely related locule-ovipositing species was unaffected by either predator exclusion or changes in vapor pressure. The results suggest that the stability of mutualisms can depend at least in part on extrinsic factors.},

abstract = {In the southern Appalachian forests, the regeneration of canopy trees is severely inhibited by Rhododendron maximum L., an evergreen understory shrub producing dense thickets. While light availability is a major cause, other factors may also contribute to the absence of tree seedlings under R. maximum. We examined the effects of R. maximum on several life history stages of tree species, including seed dispersal, seed bank germination, seedling growth, and survivorship. We found no significant effect of R. maximum on seed reaching the forest floor for Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus rubra, Quercus prinus, Carya spp., and Nyssa sylvatica. This indicates that either seed output of maternal trees rooted within the thicket were unaffected by R. maximum or seed dispersal from surrounding areas into thickets compensated for a lower seed production of canopy trees rooted in the thickets. Germination of tree seeds (A. rubrum, L. tulipifera, Q. rubra, and Betula lenta) from the seed bank also was not reduced by leaves and substrates within the thickets. Seedling mortality of all species (Q. rubra, Prunus serotina, and Tsuga canadensis) planted in our experimental plots was up to fivefold higher in thickets of R. maximum compared with those outside the thickets. The order of mortality under the R. maximum thickets,, was consistent with the shade tolerance Prunus 1 Quercus 1 Tsuga ranking of these species. Loss of Tsuga seedlings was attributed to burial by litter rather than shade. Surviving seedlings of Quercus and Prunus in R. maximum thickets were taller than those outside the thickets, but the seedlings in R. maximum thickets produced significantly fewer leaves, smaller total leaf area, leaf mass, and stem mass. Leaf N ({\%}) was significantly higher in Quercus seedlings in R. maximum thickets compared with seedlings outside the thickets. Moreover, no difference was found in leaf N ({\%}) between forest types for Prunus and Tsuga, indicating that seedlings in R. maximum thickets were not N limited. Rather, light limitation, herbivory, and litter fall contributed to the lack of tree regeneration under R. maximum thickets.},

abstract = {In river-floodplain ecosystems with seasonal flood pulses, many species display adaptations to take advantage of resources in the aquatic-terrestrial transition zone. Frugivory and seed dispersal by fishes is a clear example of such adaptations, known primarily from South American river-floodplain systems. Here, we document consumption of red mulberry (Morus rubra) and swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata) fruit by channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) in the floodplain of the Mississippi River, U.S.A., and demonstrate that red mulberry and swamp privet seeds will germinate after being consumed by channel catfish. In a common-garden experiment, consumption of fruits and seeds by channel catfish improved germination success of these riparian plants relative to a treatment simulating fruit dropped during a flood without being consumed by fish. This is the first study to provide evidence of frugivory and viability of seeds ingested by fish in a North American river-floodplain ecosystem. Frugivory and seed dispersal by fishes may be more widespread than previously thought.},

abstract = {Studies focusing on pairwise interactions between plants and herbivores may not give an accurate picture of the overall selective effect of herbivory, given that plants are often eaten by a diverse array of herbivore species. The outcome of such interactions may be further complicated by the effects of plant hybridization. Hybridization can lead to changes in morphological, phenological and chemical traits that could in turn alter plant-herbivore interactions. Here we present results from manipulative field experiments investigating the interactive effects of multiple herbivores and plant hybridization on the reproductive success of Ipomopsis aggregata formosissima X I. tenuituba. Results showed that ungulate herbivores alone had a net positive effect on plant relative fitness, increasing seed production approximately 2- fold. Caterpillars had no effect on plant relative fitness when acting alone, with caterpillar-attacked plants producing the same number of flowers, fruits and seeds as the uneaten controls. Caterpillars, however, significantly reduced flower production of ungulate browsed plants. Flower production in these plants, however, was still significantly greater (approximately 1.7-fold greater) than uneaten controls, likely leading to an increase in reproductive success through the paternal component of fitness given that fruit and seed production was not significantly different from that of herbivore-free controls. Although results suggest that herbivore imposed selection is pairwise, ungulates likely have a large influence on the abundance of, and hence the amount of damage caused by, caterpillar herbivores. Thus, because of the ecological interactions between ungulates and caterpillars, selection on Ipomopsis may be diffuse rather than pairwise, assuming such interactions translate into differential effects on plant fitness as herbivore densities vary. Plant hybridization had no significant effect on patterns of ungulate or caterpillar herbivory; i.e., no significant interactions were detected between herbivory and plant hybridization for any of the fitness traits measured in this study nor did plant hybridization have any significant effect on host preference. These results may be due to patterns of introgression or the lack of species-specific differences between I. aggregata formosissima and I. tenuituba. Plant hybridization per se resulted in lowered reproductive success of white colored morphs due in part to the effects of pollination. Although it appears that there would be strong directional selection favoring darker flower colors due to the lower reproductive success of the white colored morphs in the short run, the natural distribution of hybrids suggest that over the long run selection either tends to average out or there are no fitness differences among morphs in most years due to the additive fitness effects of hawkmoth and hummingbird pollinators.},

abstract = {Pollinator-mediated selection is one of the most important factors driving adaptation in flowering plants. However, as ecological conditions change through habitat loss and fragmentation, the interactions among species may evolve in new and unexpected directions. Human-induced environmental variation is likely to affect selection regimes, but as yet no empirical examples have been reported. In the study reported here, we examined the influence of human-induced habitat transformation on the composition of pollinator assemblages and, hence, pollinator-mediated selection on the flower phenotype of Viola portalesia (Violaceae). Our results indicate that pollinator assemblages differed substantially in terms of species composition and visitation rate between nearby native and transformed habitats. Similarly, the insect species that contributed most to visitation rates differed between plant populations. While the magnitude and sign of pollinator-mediated selection on flower length and width did not differ between sites, selection for flower number lost significance in the transformed habitat, and a significant pattern of disruptive selection for flower shape, undetected in the native habitat, was present in the transformed one. Overall, the results of this study suggest that human-induced habitat change may not only modify the species composition of pollinator assemblages, relaxing the selection process on some flower characters, but they may also create new opportunities for fitness-trait covariation not present in pristine conditions.},

Herbivory was significantly lower on control plants (ants maintained) than on experimental plants (ants removed), demonstrating the role of the ants as defenses against herbivores. Herbivory rates in open and disturbed areas were higher than in the forest understory. Ant exclusion experiments showed that both timid and aggressive ants protect their host plants against potential herbivores by killing or warding off scouts of leaf-cutter ants (Atta sp.) and removing the eggs of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera from the surface of the plants.},

We investigate these questions in the context of the plant-mycorrhizal fungal mutualism by building a biological market model potentially applicable to other mutualisms as well. We examine the situation where a single plant selectively utilizes member(s) of a group of ectomycorrhizal potential trading partners. Under biologically realistic circumstances, the plant may simultaneously utilize multiple partners, its degree of utilization determining the community structure of the fungi. If utilization of multiple partners is optimal, the marginal cost of acquiring additional nitrogen from every trading partner must be equal while the marginal cost of acquiring it from any unutilized partner must be larger. Because the plant's nitrogen demand is light dependent, the composition of the fungal species among its trading partners changes along light-availability gradients. We discuss the design of an experiment to test the key prediction of our model, the equalization of marginal cost.},

A total of 1,843 seeds of Plocama pendula (Rubiaceae), an endemic species of the Canary Islands, were found in an analysis of 1;200 faeces collected in three different zones of a ravine located on Tenerife island (riverbed, hillside and sloping zone). The external damage produced by rabbits upon the seeds was relatively low (16.5{\%} of broken seeds) and significant differences in germination percentage were found when comparing with control seeds collected on the plants (plants: 66.5{\%} vs rabbits: 34.5{\%}), Furthermore, seeds from plants germinated significantly earlier than those from rabbit's droppings. This experiment was performed over two months. In terms of frequency of seed occurrences, the highest value was found in the riverbed (77.5{\%}), decreasing gradually away from this habitat (16.4{\%} on hillside and 6.1{\%} in the sloping zone). Furthermore, it is in the riverbed where the species reaches the highest density of plants. This is a clear case where an introduced herbivore is interacting with the seed dispersal system together with the native frugivore species (lizards and warblers).},

I investigated the role of Hoplodactylus maculatus (common gecko) in frugivory and seed dispersal by measuring levels of fruit removal, dispersal distances, and the effects of gut passage and seed deposition patterns on germination success. Common geckos appeared to be the major frugivore of Coprosma propinqua, removing large quantities of fruit. Forty percent of gecko droppings collected contained seeds, over 95{\%} of which were from C. propinqua. Common geckos dispersed C propinqua seeds up to at least 9.3 m. Ingestion of C propinqua seeds by common geckos had no effect on germination success, with 72{\%} of seeds germinating. Geckos tend to deposit seeds beneath rocks; these microhabitats appear to be suitable for germination of C. propinqua, with high levels of mean seed germination (73{\%}). These results provide strong evidence that fruit is an important component of the diet of Hoplodactylus maculatus, and that common geckos provide effective seed dispersal for C. propinqua.},

abstract = {Many plants induce defenses against herbivores following initial attack. Maternal effects associated with herbivory could mediate induced defenses across generations of plants if damaged plants produce more resistant progeny than undamaged plants. I report that wild radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum) damaged by herbivores (Pieris rapae) or treated with a chemical elicitor of induced resistance (jasmonic acid) during the vegetative growth stage, induced resistance of the plants' progeny compared to controls. Conversely, clipping of leaves with scissors, which results in loss of photosynthetic area but not induced resistance, tended to increase susceptibility of progeny plants to P. rapae compared to controls. Progeny plants exhibited further induced resistance when damaged as seedlings, although maternally induced plants were less inducible than maternal-control plants. Her-bivory in the maternal generation also affected the growth of progeny plants in two ways: (1) seed mass, which was influenced by maternal herbivory, strongly positively correlated with early plant growth; and (2) when seed mass was accounted for, maternal herbivory still had an effect on plant growth, but these effects varied by plant family. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the defensive phenotype of plants is determined, in part, by the maternal environment, and that this allocation can affect the growth trajectories of progeny.},

Recruitment was restricted to damaged leaves. No increment in recruitment rates was observed in undamaged, adjacent leaves. Different levels of leaf damage did not elicit differences in recruitment rates.

Blackbirds concentrate at fruiting trees and individuals may remain there for several days. Birds usually forage in small groups and return at intervals of 12-14 minutes. Conclusion The Blackbird population of the study area forages extensively on the energy-rich Laurel fruits, while the plants depend exclusively on this bird species for seed dispersal.

abstract = {The interaction between yuccas and yucca moths has been central to understanding the origin and loss of obligate mutualism and mutualism reversal. Previous systematic research using mtDNA sequence data and characters associated with genitalic morphology revealed that a widespread pollinator species in the genus Tegeticula was in fact a complex of pollinator species that differed in host use and the placement of eggs into yucca flowers. Within this mutualistic clade two nonpollinating " cheater" species evolved. Cheaters feed on yucca seeds but lack the tentacular mouthparts necessary for yucca pollination. Previous work suggested that the species complex formed via a rapid radiation within the last several million years. In this study, we use an expanded mtDNA sequence data set and AFLP markers to examine the phylogenetic relationships among this rapidly diverging clade of moths and compare these relationships to patterns in genitalic morphology. Topologies obtained from analyses of the mtDNA and AFLP data differed significantly. Both data sets, however, corroborated the hypothesis of a rapid species radiation and suggested that there were likely two independent species radiations. Morphological analyses based on oviposition habit produced species groupings more similar to the AFLP topology than the mtDNA topology and suggested the two radiations coincided with differences in oviposition habit. The evolution of cheating was reaffirmed to have evolved twice and the closest pollinating relative for one cheater species was identified by both mtDNA and AFLP markers. For the other cheater species, however, the closest pollinating relative remains ambiguous, and mtDNA, AFLP, and morphological data suggest this cheater species may be diverged based on host use. Much of the divergence in the species complex can be explained by geographic isolation associated with the evolution of two oviposition habits.

The large, stony endocarps of Attalea butyraceae decay slowly and bear distinctive scars when opened by rodents or beetles. We determined the final distance between endocarps and reproductive trees (which we call an ecologically effective dispersal distance), the predation status of each endocarp, and the distance between seedlings and reproductive trees. The 68 focal trees were divided among 14 sites and four levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Levels of disturbance included full protection from poachers, light and heavy pressure from poachers, and small island habitat fragments. Ecologically effective seed dispersal distances were greatest for protected sites, intermediate for lightly poached sites, and shortest for heavily poached sites and habitat fragments. Seed predation by rodents increased with distance to the nearest reproductive Attalea and was greatest for fully protected sites, intermediate for lightly poached sites, and least for heavily poached sites and habitat Fragments. Seed predation by beetles reversed the patterns described for seed predation by rodents. Total seed predation by beetles and rodents combined was independent of distance, greatest for fully protected sites, and lower for poached sites and habitat fragments. Seedling densities were always greatest close to reproductive trees; however, the increase in seedling densities close to reproductive trees was minimal for fully protected sites, clearly evident for poached sites, and pronounced for habitat Fragments.

abstract = {Ecological theory has long supported the idea that species coexistence in a homogeneous habitat is promoted by spatial structure, but empirical evidence for this hypothesis has lagged behind theory. Here we describe a Neotropical ant-plant symbiosis that is ideally suited for testing spatial models of coexistence. Two genera of ants, Allomerus cf. demerarae and three species of Azteca are specialized to live on a single species of ant-plant, Cordia nodosa, in a Western Amazonian tropical rain forest. Empirically, using census data from widely separated localities, we show that the relative colonization abilities of the two ant genera are a function of plant density. A parameterized model shows that this pattern alone is sufficiently robust to explain coexistence in;the system. Census and experimental data suggest that Azteca queens are better long-distance flyers, but that Allomerus colonies are more fecund. Thus, Azteca can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are low land parent colony-sapling distances are long), and Allomerus can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are high. Existing spatial heterogeneity in host-plant densities therefore can allow regional coexistence, and intersite dispersal can produce local mixing. In conclusion, a dispersal-fecundity trade-off appears to allow the two genera to treat spatial heterogeneity in patch density as a niche axis. This study further suggests that a spatially structured approach is essential in understanding the persistence of some mutualisms in the presence of parasites.},

abstract = {The spatial structure of plant communities as well as the quality and abundance of neighbours can strongly influence the intensity of herbivory suffered by a plant. In this paper, we study the effect of the association with shrubs on the ungulate herbivory suffered by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ., Pinaceae) saplings in two isolated, fragmented populations in southeastern Spain. For this, we monitored herbivory on saplings with regard to the microhabitat in which they grew. We distinguished pines growing in open interspaces, on the edge of shrubs and within the canopy of shrubs, and also we distinguished four functional types of shrubs: thorny shrubs, nonthorny shrubs, thorny scrubs, and nonthorny scrubs. Our results show that association with shrubs increases the damage inflicted on Scots pine saplings. In fact, saplings growing in the open patches, far from the shrubs, escaped from herbivory more frequently and incurred less damage than did saplings growing close to shrubs. However, herbivory was also reduced when pine saplings were completely surrounded by shrubs, since then they served as a mechanical barrier. The type of neighbouring shrub did not affect the overall damage suffered by pines, despite the fact that the ungulates damaged the nonthorny scrubs more intensely than the other kinds of shrubs. Consequently, saplings have an advantage when growing within the canopy of shrubs; these constitute key microsites for pine recruitment in these Mediterranean forests.},

A particularly fertile area is the interaction between internal feeding parasitoids and their hosts. Hosts have evolved a variety of means of combating parasitoids, in particular cellular encapsulation, while parasitoids have evolved a wide range of countermeasures. Studies of the evolution of host resistance and parasitoid Virulence are reviewed, with an emphasis on work involving Drosophila and its parasitoids. Genetic variation in both traits has been demonstrated using isofemale line and artificial selection techniques. Recent studies have investigated the fitness costs of maintaining the ability to resist parasitoids, the comparative fitness of flies that have successfully defended themselves against parasitoids, and the degree to which resistance and virulence act against one or more species of host or parasitoid. A number of studies have examined geographical patterns, and sought to look for local adaptation; or have compared the traits across a range of species. Finally, the physiological and genetic basis of change in resistance and virulence is being investigated. While concentrating on Drosophila, the limited amount of work on different systems is reviewed, and other possible areas of coevolution in host-parasitoid interactions are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {High variability in plant-growth response to the presence of different mycorrhizal fungi can be a major determinant of local plant species diversity. Multiple species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in terrestrial ecosystems, and co-occurring plants can differ in their response to colonization by these different fungi. However, the range of mycorrhizal plant-growth responses that can occur within communities has not been determined. In the present study, I crossed a large number of plant and fungal species that co- occur to determine the range of responses that can exist within an ecosystem. I also crossed exotic fungal isolates vs. local plant isolates and local fungal isolates vs. exotic plant isolates to determine whether the range of plant growth responses differs when using foreign genotypes. The data indicate that plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation within an ecosystem can range from highly parasitic to highly mutualistic. In this study, the direction and magnitude of the response depended on the combination of plant and fungal species. No plant did best with the same fungal isolate. The range of responses was greatest when using local plants and fungi. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic responses were also detected when using foreign plant or fungal genotypes, the range of responses was significantly reduced, as was the relative frequency of positive responses. Overall, this study suggests that, within ecosystems, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can function along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism, and that extreme responses are more common when using locally adapted plants and fungi. This high variation in plant growth response may be a large contributor to plant species coexistence and the structure of plant communities.},

These large late-season grasses are much more productive per area covered than P. arundinacea or the other two C-3 grasses present, Elymus virginicus L, and Poa pratensis L, Even at this early stage of succession, C-4 produetion in plots burned in May was 5 to 6 times that in the other 2 treatments. August burns produced a mix of C-3 and C-4 grasses but did not strongly favor the pre-treatment C-3 dominant P. arundinacea. Unburned plots most resembled those burned in August in species composition, but differed in having 4 times the accumulated litter, perhaps foretelling divergence in C-3 and C-4 composition as succession proceeds.},

Six plots were established in 1997 in the Sierra Nevada, Spain; three were fenced to exclude native ungulates, and the remaining were open to ungulates. I determined pollinator and ungulate preferences for plant traits and their effect on plant fecundity. Then I compared the selection regimes between plants excluded from herbivores and plants open to them. When ungulates were absent, I found significant selection on flower number, reproductive stalk height, basal diameter of the stalks, petal length, and inner diameter of the flowers. When ungulates were present, selection on floral traits completely disappeared, and selection strength on flower number and morphological traits decreased. This effect was due to the ungulate preference for larger plants and the phenotypic correlations between plant size and floral traits. Results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection can be disrupted by conflicting effects of plant enemies acting during or subsequent to pollination. An accurate picture of the pollinator role as selective pressure requires the consideration of the entire life cycle of the plant as well as the ecological scenario in which the interactions occur.},

Preliminary results show that recruitment of seedlings and juveniles of 31 animal-dispersed tree species was more than three times greater in continuous forest and large forest fragments (greater than or equal to 30 ha) than in small forest fragments (less than or equal to 59 ha), whereas recruitment of eight wind- and gravity-dispersed trees of the forest interior was unaffected. Recruitment of 10 endemic, animal-dispersed tree species was 40 times lower in small fragments than in continuous forest or large fragments. Counts of diurnal primates and birds in all five sites indicated that frugivorous species have declined with decreasing fragment size. These results are consistent with the idea that loss of dispersal agents depresses tree recruitment in the course of forest fragmentation.},

abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls.The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain.Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions:1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows.2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions.3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change.4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions.5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered.We have high confidence in the following conclusions:1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning.2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems.3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options.Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas:1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects.2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers.3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity.4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies.5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary.Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

We hypothesized that the abiotic environment mediates the interaction between an ant-dispersed plant, Datura wrightii (Solanaceae), ant mutualists, and rodent seed predators in the Sonoran Desert. Field experiments contrasting diurnal and nocturnal seed collection rates in the presence of ants only, vertebrates only, and in the presence of both groups indicated that 85{\%} of seed collection by mammalian seed predators occurred at night (between 1900 and 0700). Seed collection by ants, in contrast, was similar between day and night, although seed collection decreased during very hot days and very bright nights. The total number of seeds collected by both groups foraging separately exceeded the number removed when both groups shared access to seed depots, suggesting that ants and rodents compete for seeds. However, D. wrightii plants dehisced 86{\%} of their fruits between 0700 and 1900, increasing the likelihood of seed collection by ant mutualists rather than rodent seed predators. Dehiscence was sensitive to environmental cues: greenhouse plants kept at constant temperature and humidity dehisced 47{\%} of their fruits between 0700 and 1900. Additional field experiments demonstrated that seed-collecting ants transported seeds considerable distances to their nests, microsites that can be rich in nutrients. The mean ( SE) seed dispersal distance was 6.1 +/- 0.5 m, the longest mean dispersal distance yet reported for an ant-dispersed seed.},

No particular fruit traits seem to be associated with seed dispersal by fishes (ichthyochory).

abstract = {Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are becoming increasingly interested in networks as a framework to study plant-animal mutualisms within their ecological context. Although such focus on networks has brought about important insights into the structure of these interactions, relatively little is still known about the mechanisms behind these patterns.The aim in this paper is to offer an overview of the mechanisms influencing the structure of plant-animal mutualistic networks. A brief summary is presented of the salient network patterns, the potential mechanisms are discussed and the studies that have evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows that researchers of plant-animal mutualisms have made substantial progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts on selected representative study systems throughout the world.},

abstract = {The effects of three herbivores on growth, survivorship, and fruit production of smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) were measured over the 1984-1986 growing seasons. The herbivores, a specialist chrysomelid beetle (Blepharida rhois), a specialist cerambycid beetle (Oberea ocellata), and whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), feed on different plant parts and are active during different times of the year. My goals were to determine (1) the effects on ramets of each herbivore separately and in combination over several years, (2) whether herbivore effects were consistent from year to year, (3) whether the history of attack affects subsequent herbivory, both within and between seasons, (4) whether herbivores interact directly, and/or indirectly, through changes in the host plant, and (5) whether any herbivore(s) emerge as particularly prominent selective agents on the plant, considering both their direct and indirect effects. Selective exclosures were used to manipulate herbivory histories of ramets. All manipulations were done in the field under natural densities of all herbivores. Herbivory treatments were cumulative over 3 yr, so that by 1986, each treatment comprised a history of 3 yr of absence/presence of browsing and beetle attack. Differing combinations of attack allowed me to detect how herbivory in one year affected ramet growth in following years. The effects of deer, chrysomelids, and cerambycids on sumac differed not only in their magnitude and direction, but also in their effects in combination. Chrysomelid herbivory (randomly assigned, using natural densities of beetles) over 3 yr was always injurious to sumac ramets. Damage in 1984 was especially injurious, and was still detectable 2-3 yr later in ramet growth, despite the absence of any subsequent herbivory. Cumulative effects of chrysomelid damage were also found, i.e., the more years a ramet was exposed to chrysomelid herbivory, the more likely it was to die. In contrast to chrysomelid damage, deer browsing was generally associated with increased ramet growth and/or reproduction. These effects were weaker and had no detectable long-term effects. The positive effects associated with browsing may reflect selectivity on the part of deer rather than positive effects of browsing, since browsing was not randomly assigned (Strauss 1988a). I found nonadditive effects of damage by different herbivores on ramet growth or mortality. For example, there was no effect of browsing on the magnitude of chrysomelid effects on ramet growth; however, browse effects on ramet growth disappeared on chrysomelid- attacked ramets, but were still apparent on ramets protected from chrysomelid herbivory. Many interactions between herbivores were found. Every pair of herbivore species, despite very different feeding habits, exhibited at least one interaction. Most interactions resulted from temporally separated herbivory events and were thus mediated by the host plant. In no cases were interactions symmetrical. From 3 yr of observations, chrysomelids were always the most injurious herbivore, deer were never injurious (and were potentially beneficial), and cerambycids, although injurious alone, were even more so in conjunction with the chrysomelid. Although the strengths of selection exerted by each herbivore varied from year to year, their relative effects on the plant did not change. From this result, I argue that selective effects of herbivores on sumac at Cedar Creek are not diffuse, but are consistent from year to year.},

abstract = {Aim As a result of the extinctions of several large frugivorous birds (and one flying fox) and the diminished ranges of others, Tonga now has a relatively small number of effective seed dispersers, especially for large-seeded plants. We estimate the bill width and gape of the two largest known extinct pigeon species (Ducula) present in Tonga prior to human arrival. We then estimate which native rain forest species had fruits that would have probably been included in the diets of these extinct birds but which may not be dispersed regularly by the smaller frugivores present today.Methods Bill width for the two largest extinct pigeons was derived by extrapolating from the size of fossil bones and measurements of skeletons of extant Ducula species. Ducula and Ptilinopus species have distensible jaws, and therefore their gape allows them to swallow objects broader than their bill width. We estimated the gape width and maximum ingestible fruit size that both the extinct and extant species could consume, by extrapolating from feeding observations of extant Ducula and Ptilinopus species (using known bill widths and fruit sizes). We determined whether those plant species whose fruit diameters exceed the mean gape width of the largest remaining avian frugivore in Tonga (Ducula pacifica Gmelin) appeared adapted for dispersal by birds or flying foxes.Results Approximately 79{\%} of the native rain forest trees and lianas in Tonga produce fruits whose morphology suggests that they are adapted to vertebrate dispersal. Bill width estimates derived from the bones of the extinct Ducula sp. nova suggest that this pigeon could swallow fruit up to 48 mm in diameter, whilst the smaller Ducula cf. david Balouet {\&} Olson is estimated to have been able to swallow fruit up to 36 mm in diameter. Plant species whose fruits are too large to be swallowed by Tonga's largest extant frugivorous bird (D. pacifica) yet display fruit characteristics suggesting birds were likely to have been their predominant vertebrate disperser in pre-human times include: Calophyllum inophyllum L., Cerbera odollam Gaertn, Planchonella garberi Christophersen, P. membranacea Lam., Pometia pinnata J. R. {\&} G. Forst., Syzygium quandrangulatum (A. Gray) Merr. {\&} Perry, Syzygium richii (A. Gray) Merr. {\&} Perry and Terminalia catappa L.Main conclusions There is now no avian disperser in Tonga for plant species whose fruits measure {\textgreater}28 mm in diameter (the maximum gape of D. pacifica). Although frugivorous flying foxes (Pteropus tonganus Quoy {\&} Gaimard) may eat the fruit and disperse the seeds of the eight plant species identified with large fruits, the frequency of dispersal by birds was probably much higher in the past. Species that once relied on the large extinct pigeons for dispersal may have become reduced in abundance in their absence.},

abstract = {We study spatial lottery models of competition between two plant species in which competitive ability is affected by levels of herbivory. Herbivory may enhance plant diversity in two qualitatively different ways. The first is global frequency dependence; the level of herbivory suffered by a plant decreases as the species becomes rare. Second, spatial variability in levels of herbivory can create ephemeral, local refuges for herbivory for each plant species. Both of these mechanisms operate only if there is not a negative correlation between a plant's palatability and its competitive ability. Both mechanisms also require that herbivores have sufficiently strong diet preferences (or, equivalently, that the plants have sufficiently different grazing tolerances). If there is no relationship between palatability and competitive ability, then plant diversity is a monotonically increasing function of the herbivore's degree of monophagy. In contrast, if there is a positive correlation between palatability and competitive ability, then the diversity/degree-of-monophagy relationship may be either monotonically increasing or humped.},

@article{Holland2006,
abstract = {Two questions central to the population ecology of mutualism include: (1) what mechanisms prevent the inherent positive feedback of mutualism from leading to unbounded population growth; and (2) what mechanisms prevent instability from arising due to overexploitation. Theory and empiricism suggest that preventing such instability requires density-dependent processes. A recent theory proposes that if benefits and costs to a mutualist vary with the density of its partner, then instability can be prevented if the former species can control demographic rates and regulate (or limit) the population density of its partner. The ecological and evolutionary feasibility of this theory of interspecific population regulation has been demonstrated using quantitative models of mutualism between plants and pollinating seed-consuming insects. In these models, resource-limited fruit set and ensuing fruit abortion are mechanisms that can lead to density-dependent recruitment and population regulation of the insects. Yet, there has been little interplay between these theoretical results and empirical research. A recent study empirically examined the density-dependent effects of resource-limited fruit set and fruit abortion in the Yucca/moth mutualism. An analysis of the study led to the conclusion that, even though fruit abortion can account for {\textgreater} 95{\%} of moth mortality, it is largely a density-independent source of mortality that cannot regulate moth population density. Here, we re-analyze those empirical data and conduct further theoretical analyses to examine the nature of fruit abortion on moth recruitment. We conclude that resource-limited fruit set and fruit abortion can effectively regulate and limit moth populations, due to its density-dependent feedback on moth recruitment. Nonetheless, in any given interaction, multiple sources of mortality may contribute to the regulation and limitation of populations, and hence the stability of mutualism, including, larval competition and mortality due to locule damage in the Yucca/moth mutualism.},

abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster is attacked by parasitoids that develop internally in the larva. They can defend themselves by a cellular immune response (host resistance), although this can be disabled by parasitoid countermeasures (parasitoid virulence). D. melanogaster and its parasitoids are an excellent system in which to study coevolution experimentally. We designed an experiment to compare changes in resistance and virulence in replicate populations of flies and parasitoids maintained together for approximately 10 fly (five parasitoid) generations. The experiment had three treatments each with three replicates: (A) no parasitoids (B) outbred parasitoids (C) partially inbred parasitoids. Host resistance increased in treatments B and C but there was no difference between these treatments. Parasitoid virulence appeared not to change during the experiment. Host larvae in treatments B and C fed at lower rates than those in A, evidence of a trade-off between resistance and larval competitive ability. We found no evidence for local adaptation, as hosts from the different replicates of treatment C performed no differently against parasitoids from the same and other replicates. Also, we found no evidence for the evolution of behavioural traits in the host that could lead to lower probabilities of being attacked. Comparing the evolution of host resistance in these seminatural settings with that in artificial selection experiments provides insight into how the conflicting selection pressures on host resistance interact.},

This study examined avian frugivory on red elderberry (Sambucus racemosa pubens), a gap-specialist that fruits in late June and early July. First, we videotaped fruiting elderberry plants (n = 67 hr) within a forest to determine which avian species ate elderberry fruit. The birds that fed most frequently on red elderberry fruits were Scarlet Tanagers (Piranga olivacea) and Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus). We then analyzed radiotelemetry data for Scarlet Tanagers to determine (1) whether tanagers shifted their territories when elderberry was in fruit, and (2) whether tanagers traveled long distances off territory to visit fruiting elderberry. During the fruiting period, male tanagers shifted their home ranges and spent more time near elderberry bushes; however, they left their territories only 0.25 times per hr and moved an average of only 115 m during trips off territory. These results suggest that while tanagers do focus their activity near fruiting elderberry, they do not leave their territories regularly to find fruit.},

The relatively conserved chloroplast gene coding rbCl allowed the estimation of the taxonomic position of Ficus relative to other genera within the Moraceae. Further, in conjunction with chloroplast tRNA spacer genes, rbcL sequences allowed the partial resolution of the phylogenetic associations of fig species from different parts of the world with representatives from all the recognized subgenera of Fiats. The phylogeny of the corresponding wasp species that pollinate most of those taxa was estimated using mitochondrial COI-COII and 12S ribosomal genes. At a fine scale, the phylogenies of species within two subgenera of figs growing in Panama (Urostigma, and Pharmacosycea) were estimated by using protein electrophoretic data. The phylogeny of the corresponding pollinator wasp species was estimated using COII sequence data. Although we need to extend the taxa sampled and augment the molecular database, the host and pollinator phylogenies show a high degree of congruence and the results support the predominance of strict-sense coevolution between figs and their pollinator wasps at both global and fine scales. },

abstract = {The unusual Rural phenology of most monoecious figs, related to their highly specialized pollination mutualism with agaonid wasps, combines pronounced dichogamy at the level of inflorescences and individuals with population-level asynchrony in flowering. This floral phenology ensures that outcrossing strongly predominates. Fig populations map thus be expected to possess deleterious recessive alleles that lead to inbreeding depression when selfing does occur. However, whether monoecious figs are self-compatible and whether selfing results in inbreeding depression have never been investigated. Using wasps as 'pollination tools' and exploiting infrequent overlap in male and female phases on the same tree, we conducted controlled selfed and outcrossed pollination experiments in Ficus aurea. Our results show that this species is totally self-compatible, No negative effects of selfing could be demonstrated on syconium retention, number of vacant ovaries, seed set, or seed germination. However wasp production had a tendency to be higher after self-pollination. While it is possible that inbreeding depression is expressed at later developmental stages, its absence at the early stages we examined is nonetheless surprising for a plant expected to be highly outcrossed. It is likely that selection pressures other than avoidance of inbreeding are responsible for the evolution and maintenance of the unusual floral phenology of figs.},

abstract = {Positive interactions among plants have been demonstrated in many communities around the world, and appear to play important roles in maintaining species coexistence, productivity, and species diversity. However, the potential for positive interactions to conserve biological diversity in ecosystems that are disturbed by humans is poorly understood and often overlooked. One of the most important positive effects one plant can have on another is protection from herbivory. By associating with an unpalatable neighbor, a tasty species may avoid being eaten and increase in size and reproductive fitness. We examined the role of two highly unpalatable plants, Cirsium obvalatum and Veratrum lobelianum, in subalpine meadow plant communities of the central Caucasus Mountains in the Republic of Georgia, where intense livestock grazing has occurred for over two thousand years. These two species are avoided by livestock because of spines and toxicity, respectively, and have increased dramatically in abundance recently due to seasonal trans-Caucasus migrations of vast herds of domestic sheep during the Soviet era. The Gudauri region, bisected by the Russian-Georgian Military Road, was a focal point of these migrations, and there we found that plant communities associated with Cirsium and Veratrum were very different in composition than open meadows. Forty-four percent (15/34) of all species at our site were found at only 'trace' ({\textless} 1.0{\%}) cover values in the open meadow, but at significantly higher covers under Cirsium or Veratrum. Of the 38 species that were reproducing sexually at our site, eight were found only under the unpalatable invaders. Communities associated with Cirsium and Veratrum had 78-128{\%} more species in flower or fruit than open meadow communities, respectively, than open meadow sites. Furthermore, community composition and reproductive output differed substantially between Cirsium and Veratrum, indicating some degree of species-specificity in their effects. These results indicate that unpalatable plants, which are generally indicators of unhealthy rangelands, have the potential to preserve plant diversity in overgrazed plant communities.},

As a model system for understanding the genomic impact of host-parasite coevolution, we have been studying the evolutionary dynamics of disease resistance genes in wild relatives of the cultivated tomato species. In this study, we investigated the sequence variation and evolutionary history of three linked genes involved in pathogen resistance in populations of Solanum peruvianum (Pto, Fen, and Prf). These genes encode proteins, which form a multimeric complex and together activate defense responses. We used standard linkage disequilibrium, as well as partitioning of linkage disequilibrium components across populations and correlated substitution analysis to identify amino acid positions that are candidates for coevolving sites between Pto/Fen and Prf. These candidates were mapped onto known and predicted structures of Pto, Fen and Prf to visualize putative coevolving regions between proteins. We discuss the functional significance of these coevolving pairs in the context of what is known from previous structure-function studies of Pto, Fen and Prf.},

abstract = {The genetic interactions which occur between hosts and parasites in natural communities are likely to be characterized by the reciprocal genetic modification of hosts by parasites and parasites by hosts. This mechanism is known as 'coevolution'. We decided to investigate in a well documented association such as the Drosophila-parasitic wasp system, if and how a coevolutionary process has developed concerning cellular resistance of the host and counterreaction or virulence of the parasite. Leptopolina boulardi is a parasitic wasp which infests the larval stage of its specific host Drosophila melanogaster. In some circumstances, the Drosophila larvae is able to develop a cellular reaction against the parasitic egg which is killed. This trait has a stable mean value over generations. With the isofemale line procedure, we demonstrated the genetic determinism of this trait and its degree of genetic variability (H(B)2 = 0.43). The genetic ability of the parasite to evade encapsulation was then investigated. Oviposition by a female wasp rapidly incapacitates the hemocytes of the host. Evaluation of H(B)2 varies from 0.31 to 0.5. These results prove that the parasitic wasp possesses the genetic variability needed to evolve and to overcome genetical resistance in its host. All the conditions were theoretically present for the development of a process of coevolution. Both D. melanogaster and its highly specific parasite L. boulardi have a very large distribution. In most populations studied, it seems that the resistance of the host is always outweighted by the virulence of the parasite. The latter was able, in this arm race with the host, to select more quickly a very efficient evading mechanism. In the mutual aggression model, if the death of the host does not imply the death of the parasite, the selective pressure toward parasite virulence will be enhanced. It is the case of parasitoid. There is also experimental evidence that flies bearing a melanotic capsule exhibit reduction in fitness. We can have an explanation why in the Drosophila-parasitic wasp system, the parasite may gain this race in most of the sites. There is a locality (Congo) where the parasite does not succeed to evade the host encapsulation. This parasite in this African locality does not develop a well defined strategy for either 5 potential hosts. This African association appears to be a demonstrative example of diffuse coevolution.},

Records of frugivory from over 75 countries are presented for 260 Ficus specie., (approximately 30 {\%} of described species). Explanations are presented for geographical and taxonomic gaps in the otherwise extensive literature. In addition to a small number of reptiles and fishes, 1274 bird and mammal species in 523 genera and 92 families are known to eat figs. III terms of the number of species and genera of fig-eaters and the number of fig species eaten we identify the avian families interacting most with Ficus to be Columbidae, Psittacidae, Pycnonotidae, Bucerotidae. Sturnidae and Lybiidae. Among mammals, the major fig-eating families are Pteropodidae, Cercopithecidae, Sciuridae, Phyllostomidac and Cebidae. We assess the role these and other frugivores play in Ficus seed dispersal and identify fig-specialists. III most, but not all, cases fig specialists provide effective seed dispersal services to the Ficus species on which they feed. The diversity of fig-eaters is explained with respect to fig design and nutrient Content, phenology of fig ripening and the diversity of fig presentation. Whilst at a gross level there exists considerable overlap between birds, arboreal mammals and fruit bats with regard to the fig species they consume, closer analysis, based on evidence from across the tropics, suggests that discrete guilds, of Ficus species differentially attract subsets of sympatric frugivore communities. This dispersal guild structure is determined by interspecific differences in fig design and presentation, Throughout our examination of the fig-frugivore interaction we consider phylogenetic factors and make comparisons between large-scale biogeographical regions. Our dataset supports previous claims that Ficus is the most important plant genus for tropical frugivores. We explore the concept of figs as keystone resources and suggest criteria for future investigations of their dietary importance. Finally, fully referenced lists of frugivores recorded at each Ficus species and of Ficus species in the diet of each frugivore are presented as online appendices. In situations where ecological information is incomplete or its retrieval is impractical, this valuable resource will assist conservationists in evaluating the role of figs or their frugivores in tropical forest sites.},

abstract = {The structure of mutualistic networks provides clues to processes shaping biodiversity [1-10]. Among them, interaction intimacy, the degree of biological association between partners, leads to differences in specialization patterns [4, 11) and might affect network organization [12]. Here, we investigated potential consequences of interaction intimacy for the structure and coevolution of mutualistic networks. From observed processes of selection on mutualistic interactions, it is expected that symbiotic interactions (high-interaction intimacy) will form species-poor networks characterized by compartmentalization [12,13], whereas nonsymbiotic interactions (low intimacy) will lead to species-rich, nested networks in which there is a core of generalists and specialists often interact with generalists [3, 5, 7,12,14]. We demonstrated an association between interaction intimacy and structure in 19 ant-plant mutualistic networks. Through numerical simulations, we found that network structure of different forms of mutualism affects evolutionary change in distinct ways. Change in one species affects primarily one mutualistic partner in symbiotic interactions but might affect multiple partners in nonsymbiotic interactions. We hypothesize that coevolution in symbiotic interactions is characterized by frequent reciprocal changes between few partners, but coevolution in nonsymbiotic networks might show rare bursts of changes in which many species respond to evolutionary changes in a single species.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated genetic variation for resistance to insect herbivores and host plant quality. The effect of plant mating system, an important determinant of the distribution of genetic variation, on host plant characteristics has received almost no attention. This study used a controlled greenhouse experiment to examine the effect of self- and cross-pollination in Mimulus guttatus (Scrophulariaceae) on resistance to and host plant quality for the xylem-feeding spittlebug Philaenus spumarius (Homoptera: Cercopidae). Spittlebugs were found to have a negative effect on two important fitness components in M. guttatus, flower production and aboveground biomass, One of two M. guttatus populations examined showed a significant interaction between the pollination and herbivore treatments. In this case. the detrimental effects of herbivores on biomass and flower production were much more pronounced in inbred (self) plants. The presence of spittlebug nymphs increased inbreeding depression by as much as three times. Pollination treatments also had significant effects on important components of herbivore fitness, but these effects were in opposite directions in our two host plant populations, Spittlebug nymphs maturing on self plants emerged as significantly larger adults in one of our host plant populations, indicating that inbreeding increased host plant quality. In our second host plant population, spittlebug nymphs took, significantly longer to develop to adulthood on self plants. indicating that inbreeding decreased host plant quality. Taken together these results suggest that the degree of inbreeding in host plant populations can have important and perhaps complex effects on the dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions and on mating-system evolution in the host.},

abstract = {The mutually beneficial interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have been paramount in the generation of Earth's biodiversity These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

This interplay between local adaptation and migration may be particularly important in structuring interactions that vary from mutualism to antagonism across the range of an interacting set of species, such as those between some plants and their insect herbivores, mammals and trypanosome parasites, and bacteria and plasmids that confer antibiotic resistance. Here we present a simple geographically structured genetic model of a coevolutionary interaction that varies between mutualism and antagonism among communities linked by migration. Inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow alters the outcomes of local interactions and allows the maintenance of allelic polymorphism across all communities under a range of selection intensities and rates of migration. Furthermore, inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow allows fu;ed mutualisms to be evolutionarily stable within both communities! even when selection on the interaction is antagonistic within one community. Moreover, the model demonstrates that the inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow may lead to considerable local maladaptation and trait mismatching as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.},

Elephants can seriously damage or kill trees by removing parts of the canopy, debark, or break the stem. We compared browsing by African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in male and female Marula trees (Sclerocarya birrea ssp. caffra). We expected females to incur more damage because of their sweet and fleshy fruits, known to attract elephants from far. Following this, we expected females to give more resistance through a denser branch wood that would break off at a larger diameter than in males. We tested this by pulling branches down to simulate elephant browsing as to compare branch resistance and design. All trees showed signs of browsing and females were generally more injured. However, there was no sexual difference in wood density and diameter at breaking point. Female branches were shorter, less ramified and carried fewer reproductive shoots than male branches. This sexual dimorphism could result from costly reproductive allocation in females and sexual selection, promoting intensive male flowering. Indirectly, elephants could reinforce this difference by engaging females more in tissue repair after browsing.},

We examine a situation in which hosts upon being infected can mount a defensive response to clear the infection, but in which there is a fecundity cost to such immunological up-regulation. We also suppose that the parasite exploits the host and thereby causes an elevated host mortality rate. We determine the coevolutionary stable strategies of the parasite's level of exploitation and the host's level of up-regulation, and illustrate the patterns of reduced host fitness (i.e., virulence) that these produce. We find that counterintuitive patterns of virulence are often expected to arise as a result of the interaction between coevolved host and parasite strategies. In particular, despite the fact that the parasite imposes only a mortality cost on the host, coevolution by the host results in a pattern whereby infected hosts always have the same probability of death from infection, but they vary in the extent to which their fecundity is reduced. This contrasts with previous results and arises from our inclusion of two important factors absent from previous theory: costs of immunological up-regulation and a more suitable measure of parasite-induced mortality.},

We studied within-fruit distributions of four seed types (fertile, infertile, eaten and uneaten seeds) in order to evaluate costs and benefits in a Yucca schottii population in southeastern Arizona. We focused on how the spatial arrangement of seeds affected larval behaviour and, hence, the costs of the mutualism to the yucca. Infertile seeds were distributed throughout both infested and uninfested locules. Additionally, moth larvae feeding in a single locule preferred fertile seeds and even avoided infertile seeds and left the fruit significantly more often when they encountered infertile seeds. We suggest that, regardless of the cause of infertile seeds, they function as blocking units within seed locules and therefore reduce seed predation by moth larvae. We also suggest that, together with certain other fruit traits, the presence of infertile seeds promotes the evolutionary stability of this pollination mutualism.},

Here, we develop general theory for the density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism based on the C--R mechanism of interspecific interaction. To test the influence of C--R interactions on the dynamics and stability of bi- and uni-directional C--R mutualisms, we developed simple models that link consumer functional response of one mutualistic species with the resources supplied by another. Phase-plane analyses show that the ecological dynamics of C--R mutualisms are stable in general. Most transient behavior leads to an equilibrium of mutualistic coexistence, at which both species densities are greater than in the absence of interactions. However, due to the basic nature of C--R interactions, certain density- dependent conditions can lead to C--R dynamics characteristic of predator--prey interactions, in which one species overexploits and causes the other to go extinct. Consistent with empirical phenomena, these results suggest that the C--R interaction can provide a broad mechanism for understanding density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism. By unifying predation, competition, and mutualism under the common ecological framework of consumer--resource theory, we may also gain a better understanding of the universal features of interspecific interactions in general.},

abstract = {Biologically derived safe sites appear to strongly affect spatial and temporal patterns in terrestrial plant communities; however, few experimental field studies have been conducted to investigate the importance of such interactions or the mechanisms by which they operate. Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata are winter-deciduous oaks endemic to California. I examined associations between seedlings of these oaks and several species of shrubs and conducted field experiments that tested for facilitative effects of two shrubs, Salvia leucophylla and Artemisia californica, on seedling survival. Naturally occurring Q. douglasii seedlings were relatively common (280 seedlings/ha) and were strongly associated with shrub canopies. In two experimental plantings, 30{\%} and 55{\%} of Q. douglasii seedlings that emerged under shrubs survived for {\textgreater} 1 yr, whereas no seedling in the open survived in either experiment. Survival of Q. douglasii where shrubs were removed was similar to survival in the open grassland, indicating that association between shrubs and oak seedlings was not due to shared microsite requirements. Q. douglasii seedling survival was not different between the two shrub species. Only three Q. lobata seedlings were found in 26 study plots, although reproductive adults were present. The seedlings were under shrub canopies. However, the survival of Q. lobata was not facilitated by shrub cover or shrub simulation and no other evidence was found for nurse-shrub interactions with this oak species. Artificial shade was critical to the survival of Q. douglasii seedlings in simulated shrub environments. When grown in artificial shade, photosynthetic capacities and root elongation rates of Q. douglasii seedlings were significantly higher than those of Q. lobata. These differences may partially explain why nurse-plant interactions exist between shrubs and Q. douglasii seedlings but not between the same shrubs and Q. lobata seedlings. Causes of acorn and seedling mortality differed between the shrub and open grassland habitats. Under shrubs, acorn predation was the primary cause of mortality, whereas mortality due to shoot herbivory was much more frequent in the open grassland.

The shade tolerance and nurse-plant utilization of Q. douglasii seedlings have parallels with shade tolerance and late successional roles of other oak species in temperate deciduous forests, and, as in these forests, may affect the long-term spatial dynamics in California woodlands.},

abstract = {Because encrusting coralline algae rely on herbivory or low light levels to prevent being overgrown by competitively superior fleshy algae, corallines are relatively rare in shallow areas with low rates of herbivory. In contrast to this general trend, the branching coralline alga Neogoniolithon strictum occurs primarily in shallow seagrass beds and along the margins of shallow reef flats where herbivory on macrophytes is low. This alga apparently persists in these habitats by providing refuge to the herbivorous crab Mithrax sculptus al mean densities of 1 crab per 75 g of algal wet mass. When crabs were removed from some host corallines, hosts without crabs supported 9 times the epiphytic growth of hosts with crabs after only 30 days. Crabs without access to a coralline alga were rapidly consumed by reef fishes, while most of those tethered near a host alga survived. These results suggest that the crabs clean their algal host of fouling seaweeds and associate with the host to minimize predation. However, to effectively clean the host, the crab must consume the wide array of macroalgae that commonly co-occur with coralline algae in these habitats, including chemically defended species in the genera Halimeda, Dictyota, and Laurencia. Crabs did readily consume these seaweeds, which were avoided by, and are chemically defended from, herbivorous fishes. Even though crabs readily consumed both Halimeda, and Dictyota in whole-plant feeding assays, chemical extracts from these species significantly reduced crab feeding, suggesting that factors other than secondary chemistry (e.g., food value, protein, energy content), may determine whole-plant palatability. Having the ability to use a wide variety of foods, and choosing the most profitable rather than the least defended foods, would diminish foraging time, increase site fidelity, and allow the crab to function mutualistically with the host alga. Despite the obvious benefit of associating with N. strictum, M. sculptus did not prefer it over other habitats offering a structurally similar refuge, suggesting that these crabs are not N. strictum specialists, but rather occupy multiple habitats that provide protection from predators. Structurally complex organisms like N. strictum may commonly suppress competitors by harboring protective symbionts like M. sculptus. It is possible that diffuse coevolution has occurred between these two groups; however, this seems unlikely because both herbivore and host appear to respond most strongly to selective pressures from predators and competitors outside this association.},

abstract = {It is well established that plants provide alternative foods to predators of herbivorous arthropods. This provision may facilitate protection against herbivory. However, plants often cannot prevent other organisms from utilizing these foods as well. There. are many examples of herbivorous arthropods that can feed on plant-provided foods such as extrafloral nectar and pollen. The question therefore arises whether individual plants still gain protection when not only the predators, but also the herbivores, can feed on these foods. We investigated this question using a mathematical model and experiments that assessed the impact of supplementary pollen on the dynamics of predatory mites (Iphiseius degenerans (Berlese)) and herbivorous thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)), two arthropods capable of using pollen for reproduction. Replicated greenhouse experiments showed that addition of pollen every two weeks to one young mature leaf of a male-sterile cucumber-plant increased predator population growth and greatly reduced herbivore numbers. A stage-structured predator-prey-pollen model with experimentally established parameter gave reasonably accurate predictions of population trends observed in the greenhouse experiments with and without pollen. Model analysis yielded three important results. First, herbivore (prey) equilibria always settled to lower values in the presence of pollen. Second, mean herbivore numbers during the transient phase following predator release were not always lower under pollen supply, depending on the initial numbers of predators and prey. Third, limiting the plant area covered with pollen led to a decrease in mean herbivore numbers; provided that the predators aggregated in (and thereby 'monopolized') pollen patches. The latter result may explain why plants provide alternative foods at specific sites.; },

Much knowledge has been gained in the last few years on the nature of these mutualisms. In this study, we review (1) the group of animals that participate in these relationships and their relative importance, (2) the community structure of these interactions, and (3) their degree of spatial consistency on a geographical scale based on studies conducted in two or more localities at both sides of the Andes. We also compare the plant-animal mutualisms of the TFSSA with those occurring in other biomes. Last, we present evidence showing how deforestation, fragmentation, and other forms of human disturbance are affecting these mutualisms. This work supports the hypothesis that the many plant species pollinated and dispersed by vertebrates in the TFFSA depend on a strikingly poor assemblage of animal mutualists. On the other hand, invertebrate- pollinated plants interact with an unexpectedly diverse assemblage of insect pollinators that include taxa present only in this biome. Although many of these mutualisms seem to be resilient, others appear highly sensitive to different forms of human disturbance.},

abstract = {Most textbook treatments imply, and almost all theoretical analyses assume, that mutualistic interactions take place between a single pair of interacting partner species. A major goal of this symposium is to broaden and shift this pairwise perspective and make it concordant with the emerging view that locally exclusive mutualisms between just two species are the exception and that many communities include guilds of mutualistic species on one or both sides of the interaction. Many pollination and seed-dispersal mutualisms have long been recognized as diffuse, but recent molecular analyses are revealing unrecognized partner diversity in mutualistic interactions previously thought to be locally species specific. Co-occurring species within a mutualist guild are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent in the way they locate, compete for, and/or reward partners, and so intraguild interactions have the potential to influence population dynamics and patterns of selection in species on both sides of the mutualistic interaction. To illustrate some of these potential complexities for population dynamics, I use simple path analytic models to show that positive pairwise interactions between mutualists do not necessarily translate into positive net interactions within a mutualism involving more than two species. For example, when there is intraguild competition for partners, or even for resources external to the mutualism, the presence of a lower-quality mutualist can negatively affect the partner population by reducing associations it can form with better mutualists. Variation in quality among potential partners is likely to place a premium on traits or behaviors that enhance association with better mutualists. More investigations are needed to determine how variation among interacting mutualists, with respect to characteristics such as longevity, dispersal capability, and competitive ability, influence population dynamics and selection in multispecies mutualisms.},

abstract = {Ant-acacias represent a classic insect-plant mutualism: the ants defend the plant from attack by herbivores, and in return are provided with trophic rewards and living space within swollen thorns. A potential drawback of this and other ant- plant mutualisms is that ant-guards may drive away useful insects, particularly pollinators. We assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict in a Mexican ant-acacia, Acacia hindsii. This Acacia is guarded by a highly aggressive ant (Pseudomyrmex veneficus), which resides entirely within the host plant canopy and is provided with extrafloral nectar and protein-rich Beltian bodies. Acacia hindsii flowers released their pollen from 0700 to 0830 hours, and were visited by pollinators from 0730 to 1300 hours. Over the same time period ants maintained high activity levels at extrafloral nectaries on young leaves. Although daily activity of ants and pollinators overlapped substantially in time, it was largely separated in space: resources exploited by the ants are predominantly concentrated within new growth, while inflorescences are present only on shoots from the previous year. Ants nevertheless visit extrafloral nectaries on older, leaves near inflorescences, and there is thus potential for ant-pollinator conflict. Bioassays of ant behavior showed young A. hindsii inflorescences induce an avoidance response in its ant-guards, which reinforces spatial segregation between ants and pollinators. This effect,is absent from buds or postreproductive flowers. Young flowers of two non- myrmecophilous Acacia species also induced significant (though less potent) repellent effects, suggesting a general role for ant-repellents in Acacia, with selective enhancement in myrmecophilous species.; },

abstract = {Herbivores may enhance plant recruitment, but such positive interactions may be overlooked in favour of obvious negative effects of herbivory on propagules. My objective was to determine whether larval insects that feed and develop within fruit of the mangrove Avicennia marina act as mutualist herbivores by increasing the dispersal of propagules without affecting their viability and emerging successfully as adults following dispersal of the propagule by water. Surveys revealed that frugivory is common throughout the mangrove forest, and fruit had up to six exit holes where larvae had emerged as adults. Larval insects did not affect the flotation of propagules with pericarps, a thin structure that provides buoyancy for dispersal by water. In contrast, after simulating germination by removing the pericarp, the majority of propagules with three exit holes floated on average for 20 h longer than those without exit holes, which sank immediately. Based on this evidence that frugivory could increase the dispersal potential of propagules, I predicted that propagules consumed by larval insects should disperse farther than undamaged propagules, and this was tested by quantifying the potential viability of propagules stranded on beaches at increasing distances (up to 20 km) from mangrove forests. Flies and moths emerged as adults after being transported tens of kilometres within mangrove propagules, revealing a novel mode of dispersal. Proportionally fewer potentially viable propagules were supplied to beaches at increasing distances from mangrove forests, however, indicating that larval insects negatively affect recruitment and are thus not acting as mutualist herbivores. Nevertheless, when transported back to the mangrove forest, seedlings established from propagules damaged by larval insects and stranded on beaches. Therefore, although frugivory does not preclude mangrove recruitment, its negative effects in the pre-dispersal environment may be intensified with increasing dispersal distance, thus limiting the long-distance supply of propagules and recruitment of mangroves.},

abstract = {Directional evolutionary trends have long garnered interest because they suggest that evolution can be predictable. However, the identification of the trends themselves and the underlying processes that may produce them have often been controversial(1). In 1862, in explaining the exceptionally long nectar spur of Angraecum sesquipedale, Darwin proposed that a coevolutionary 'race' had driven the directional increase in length of a plant's spur and its pollinator's tongue(2). Thus he predicted the existence of an exceptionally long-tongued moth. Though the discovery of Xanthopan morgani ssp. praedicta in 1903 with a tongue length of 22 cm validated Darwin's prediction(3), his 'race' model for the evolution of long-spurred flowers remains contentious(4). Spurs may also evolve to exceptional lengths by way of pollinator shifts as plants adapt to a series of unrelated pollinators, each with a greater tongue length(5). Here, using a species-level phylogeny of the columbine genus, Aquilegia, we show a significant evolutionary trend for increasing spur length during directional shifts to pollinators with longer tongues. In addition, we find evidence for 'punctuated' change in spur length during speciation events(6), suggesting that Aquilegia nectar spurs rapidly evolve to fit adaptive peaks predefined by pollinator morphology. These findings show that evolution may proceed in predictable pathways without reversals and that change may be concentrated during speciation.},

We develop a genetically explicit model of coevolution that bridges the gap between these approaches by allowing genetic variation itself to evolve. Analysis of this model shows that the evolution of genetic variance has important consequences for the dynamics and outcome of coevolution. Of particular importance is our demonstration that coevolutionary cycles can emerge in the absence of stabilizing selection, an outcome not possible in previous models of coevolution mediated by quantitative traits. Whether coevolutionary cycles evolve depends upon the strength of selection, the number of loci, and the rate of mutation in each of the interacting species. Our results also generate novel predictions for the expected sign and magnitude of linkage disequilibria in each species.},

We used this disjunction in distribution to test the hypothesis that A. longimana populations co-occurring with Dictyota would have greater tolerance for the seaweed.'s chemical defenses and would display higher feeding preference for, and fitness on, the seaweed than would more northerly populations. We also evaluated the genetic vs. phenotypic basis of these patterns and attempted to detect trade-offs between tolerance for Dictyota and ability to use other plants as foods. Such geographic studies of herbivory have been conducted using terrestrial insects, but few studies have focused on other herbivores, and this is especially true for marine systems, In multiple-choice feeding assays with both field-collected and laboratory-reared adults, a North Carolina population of A. longimana sympatric with Dictyota more readily fed on Dictyota and was more resistant to Dictyota's deterrent chemistry than was a Connecticut population from outside of Dictyota's geographic range. When raised on Dictyota menstrualis and D. ciliolata, A. longimana juveniles from North Carolina grew faster, matured faster, and produced more reproductivefemales than did Connecticut juveniles. The differential tolerance for Dictyota, has a genetic basis, as it was maintained through two generations grown to maturity in a common environment. When several northern and southern populations were assayed, they displayed similar regional differences in feeding preferences. Though southern juveniles had higher fitness on Dictyota than northern juveniles, southern juveniles performed as well as northern juveniles when raised on seven other seaweeds, including seaweeds (e.g., Fucus vesiculosus and Sargassum filipendula) that produce secondary metabolites in a different class from those found in Dictyota. Thus, tolerating Dictyota did not incur detectable performance trade-offs when juveniles were confined to feeding on alternative seaweeds. Our results suggest that the evolution of host preferences may depend more on the host value as a refuge from enemies than on minimizing the costs of tolerating plant secondary metabolites.; },

abstract = {We examine the role of the native fox, Pseudalopex culpaeus, as a frugivore and seed disperser in a semiarid thornscrub of Chile. We quantified the fruit and animal components in its diet versus the availability of fruits and small mammals in the field over a 2-year period (January 1998 through February 2000). We tested the legitimacy and effectiveness of foxes as dispersers by quantifying the percentages of seed viability and of germination of seeds that passed through fox gut versus those picked from plants. We also studied their efficiency as dispersers, monitoring the fate of seeds in faeces placed in the field. The highest frequencies of fruit consumption by foxes were observed when abundances of small mammal prey were {\textless} 6 individuals per hectare, regardless of fruit abundance in the field. Thus, foxes consumed fruits as a supplementary food resource. Based on 326 faeces, the total number of fruits consumed was about 34 000 over the 2-year study period, and fruits from the alien shrub Schinus molle represented 98{\%} of that total, with the native Porlieria chilensis a distant second. Germination and viability of defecated seeds of P. chilensis were reduced by 66{\%} and 48{\%}, respectively, in comparison to controls. In contrast, germination of seeds of S. molle increased by 50{\%} and no effect on viability was observed. With regard to P. chilensis, foxes were legitimate (they defecated viable seeds), but ineffective (seeds in faeces had lower germination than those taken directly from parental plants and there was no seedling establishment in the field) and inefficient dispersers (seeds in faeces were deposited on microhabitats hostile to seed germination and seedling establishment). However, with regard to S. molle, foxes were legitimate, effective (seeds in faeces had higher germination than those taken directly from parental plants; there was germination but no establishment in the field), and efficient dispersers (over 41{\%} of seeds were deposited on safe microsites). Thus, a native fox may be contributing to the spread of an alien shrub, co-opting existing community processes.},

An additional, highly diversified, species-specific pollination mutualism between a monoecious tree genus, Glochidion (Euphorbiaceae), and a moth genus, Epicephala (Gracillariidae), is presented here. At night, the small female moth actively deposits pollen on the cryptic stigma of the female flower by using its proboscis, then oviposits into the style. The moth larva infests only a portion of the developing seeds within fruit. We confirmed that at least three Glochidion species are pollinated only by their respective seed-parasitic moth species, which could be distinguished by genitailic morphology and mitochondrial DNA sequences. These results and widespread evidence of limited seed infestation by the moths associated with Glochidion species suggest that speciation based on the highly specialized Glochidion stylar structure and moth oviposition behavior have promoted species diversification in Glochidion and its pollinators.},

abstract = {The indirect effects of hosts on interactions between parasites and other species are not well understood, and it may be difficult to predict the outcome of host species effects on parasite performance due to the complexity of potential direct and indirect effects. For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.; },

We investigated the reproductive ecology of two closely related, woody legumes. Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and Genista monspessulana (French broom). invading the same sites. Both species are considered noxious non-native weeds in California. and are considered to be ecologically similar. but Genista has much smaller flowers than Cytisus. Neither species showed appreciable levels of autogamous selfing. When experimentally self-pollinated, Genista demonstrated less depression of fruit set and seed set relative to outcrossed flowers than did Cytisus. At two sites on the Marin peninsula. Calif., Genista flowers were consistently less likely to be pollinated than Cytisus flowers. Genista was significantly pollen limited at both sites. while Cytisus was pollen limited at only the site with lower visitation rates. In the three populations with demonstrable pollen limitation. we found a significant relationship between fruit production and natural pollinator visitation at the level of the individual plant. However. we did not find that overall patterns of fecundity were strongly predicted by differences in pollen limitation between species or between sites. While a previous study found a tight link between patterns of pollinator visitation and patterns of reproduction in Cytisus in Washington State. we conclude that a more complex and variable environment (in terms of resources. herbivores. and florivores) on the Marin Peninsula de-coupled the relationship between pollinators and fruit production in these invaders. Our results suggest that the role of mutualisms in promoting or constraining invasions is likely to vary considerably among invaded communities.},

abstract = {Seed predator/pollinator and host plant interactions, which may be considered as antagonistic, have the potential to provide good model systems for the study of the early stages of evolution towards mutualism. I describe a relationship between a seed predator, the geometrid moth Perizoma affinitatum, and the dioecious plant Silene dioica. The moth is an obligate seed predator on its host plant. The searching and ovipositing behaviour of the female moths, number of eggs deposited per flower, the pollinating ability of the moths and the seed consumption by the larvae are described as different parameters and studied in two Finnish coastal populations. A high pollinating ability and limited seed consumption by the predator was found and discussed in relation to fitness models of P. affinitatum and S. dioica. In a mutualistic relationship there must be a balance between the costs and benefits so that the seed production by the moths is larger than the seed consumption by the larvae, given a net seed output larger than zero. The data of the parameters included in a seed production/consumption model give a positive seed output when the proportion of S. dioica flowers pollinated by other non-predating insects is less than 60{\%}. Accordingly, even if P. affinitatum would become the exclusive pollinator it would not endanger the survival of the host plant and both partners would benefit from this interaction. Limited seed consumption, high pollinating ability and host specificity as seen in the P. affinitatum and S. dioica interaction are considered to have been important pre-existing qualities in the evolution of the obligate mutualisms between yucca and yucca moths and fig and fig wasps. In isolated serpentine populations where the gene flow is restricted and co-pollinators are rare the interaction between P. affinitatum and S. dioica has the potential to shift from parasitism to mutualism.},

abstract = {Because coevolution takes place across a broad scale of time and space, it is virtually impossible to understand its dynamics and trajectories by studying a single pair of interacting populations at one time. Comparing populations across a range of an interaction, especially for long-lived species, can provide insight into these features of coevolution by sampling across a diverse set of conditions and histories. We used measures of prey traits (tetrodotoxin toxicity in newts) and predator traits (tetrodotoxin resistance of snakes) to assess the degree of phenotypic mismatch across the range of their coevolutionary interaction. Geographic patterns of phenotypic exaggeration were similar in prey and predators, with most phenotypically elevated localities occurring along the central Oregon coast and central California. Contrary to expectations, however, these areas of elevated traits did not coincide with the most intense coevolutionary selection. Measures of functional trait mismatch revealed that over one-third of sampled localities were so mismatched that reciprocal selection could not occur given current trait distributions. Estimates of current locality-specific interaction selection gradients confirmed this interpretation. In every case of mismatch, predators were "ahead" of prey in the arms race; the converse escape of prey was never observed. The emergent pattern suggests a dynamic in which interacting species experience reciprocal selection that drives arms-race escalation of both prey and predator phenotypes at a subset of localities across the interaction. This coadaptation proceeds until the evolution of extreme phenotypes by predators, through genes of large effect, allows snakes to, at least temporarily, escape the arms race.},

This study tests for correlations between fruit colour and other plant attributes in the New Zealand fleshy-fruited flora consistent with these predictions.

Within shrubs and subshrubs, white and blue fruit colours. were associated with small fruit size, and with open habitats if Coprosma species were excluded.

Phenotypic plasticity in mutualistic interactions allows organisms to produce rewards to attract mutualists when the benefits of their presence outweigh the costs of producing the rewards. In ant-plant defensive mutualisms, defences are indirect as plants produce extra-floral nectaries (EFN) to attract predatory ants to deter herbivores. Here we demonstrate that in broad bean, Vicia faba, the overall number of EFNs on a plant increases dramatically following leaf damage. In two damage treatments, removal of: (1) one-third of one leaf in a single leaf pair or (2) one-third of both halves of a single leaf pair, resulted in a 59 and 106{\%} increase in the number of EFNs on the plants, respectively, over 1 week. We suggest that the increased production of visually conspicuous EFNs is an adaptive inducible response, to attract predatory arthropods when risk of herbivory increases.},

Quantifying the magnitude of selection is crucial to understanding which aspects of the environment are important to the evolution of a species. Such knowledge is particularly important to fields such as conservation biology, which attempts to maintain a suitable environment for the prosperity of a species, or coevolution, where dynamics are determined by the strength of reciprocal selection between species. I present a general method by which selection due to interspecific interactions may be quantified. This technique is based on past quantitative genetic models of selection and can be used with other methodologies that build on these standard models. The approach may be expanded to account for n-species interactions ( e. g., a plant with two pollinators). Simulation studies conducted using this method indicate that the magnitude of selection between two species is strongly correlated with the presence of nonrandom interactions.},

Here we confirm that current coevolutionary selection in interspecific interactions can be highly divergent across both narrow and broad geographic scales, thereby fuelling continuing coevolution of taxa. Study of a widespread plant-insect interaction across a broad range of habitats for several years showed that an insect functioning both as a pollinator and a floral parasite can be strongly mutualistic in some habitats but commensal or antagonistic in neighbouring habitats. The results for one of the habitats span seven years, demonstrating that the local structure of coevolutionary selection can remain stable across multiple generations. Conservation of the evolutionary processes maintaining long-term biological diversity may require preservation of the conditions that allow a long-term shifting geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots.},

abstract = {Food webs in nature have multiple, reticulate connections between a diversity of consumers and resources. Such complexity affects web dynamics: it first spreads the direct effects of consumption and productivity throughout the web rather than focusing them at particular ''trophic levels.'' Second, consumer densities are often donor controlled with food from across the trophic spectrum, the herbivore and detrital channels, other habitats, life-history omnivory, and even trophic mutualism. Although consumers usually do not affect these resources, increased numbers often allow consumers to depress other resources to levels lower than if donor-controlled resources were absent. We propose that such donor-controlled and ''multichannel'' omnivory is a general feature of consumer control and central to food web dynamics. This observation is contrary to the normal practice of inferring dynamics by simplifying webs into a few linear ''trophic levels,'' as per ''green world'' theories. Such theories do not accommodate common and dynamically important features of real webs such as the ubiquity of donor control and the importance and dynamics of detritus, omnivory, resources crossing habitats, life history, nutrients (as opposed to energy), pathogens, resource defenses, and trophic symbioses. We conclude that trophic cascades and top-down community regulation as envisioned by trophic-level theories are relatively uncommon in nature.},

However, models for mutualistic community assembly are still needed, especially because these communities are experiencing significant anthropogenic disturbances that affect their biodiversity. Here, we present a unique network model that simulates the colonization and extinction process of mutualistic community assembly. We generate regional source pools of species interaction networks on the basis of statistical properties reported in the literature. We develop a dynamic synchronous Boolean framework to simulate, with few free parameters, the dynamics of new mutualistic community formation from the regional source pool. This approach allows us to deterministically map out every possible trajectory of community formation. This level of detail is rarely observed in other analytic approaches and allows for thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of community formation. As for food web assembly, we find that the number of stable communities is quite low, and the composition of the source pool influences the abundance and nature of community outcomes. However, in contrast to food web assembly, stable mutualistic communities form rapidly. Small communities with minor fluctuations in species presence/absence (self-similar limit cycles) are the most common community outcome. The unique application of this Boolean network approach to the study of mutualistic community assembly offers a great opportunity to improve our understanding of these critical communities.},

abstract = {Host-parasite associations are assumed to be ecologically specialized, tightly coevolved systems driven by mutual modification in which host switching is a rare phenomenon. Ecological fitting, however, increases the probability of host switching, creating incongruences between host and parasite phylogenies, when (1) specialization on a particular host resource is a shared characteristic of distantly related parasites, and (2), the resource being tracked by the parasite is widespread among many host species. We investigated the effect of ecological fitting on structuring the platyhelminth communities of anurans from a temperate forest and grassland in the United States and tropical dry and wet forests in Mexico and Costa Rica. The six communities all exhibit similar structure in terms of the genera and families inhabiting the frogs. Parasite species richness is highly correlated with the amount of time a host spends in association with aquatic habitats, a conservative aspect of both parasite and host natural history, and determined in a proximal sense by host mobility and diet breadth. The pattern of parasite. genera and families within host genera across the regions examined is consistent with the prediction that ecological fitting by phylogenetically conservative species, coupled with historical accidents of speciation and dispersal, should be evidenced as a nested-subset structure; the shared requirement for aquatic habitats of tadpoles provides a baseline assemblage to which other parasite taxa are added as a function of adult host association with aquatic habitats. We conclude that parasite communities are structured by both ecological fitting and coevolution (mutual modification), the relative influences of which are expected to vary among different communities and associations.},

abstract = {Context dependency, variation in the outcome of species interactions with biotic and abiotic conditions, is increasingly considered ubiquitous among mutualisms. Despite several qualitative reviews of many individual empirical studies, there has been little quantitative synthesis examining the generality of context dependency, or conditions that may promote it. We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context-dependent effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth, reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater than 0. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however. Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extra. oral nectar, food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory were greater in tropical vs. temperate systems. Although ant-plant interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta-analyses, indicate that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic interactions. Rather, ant-plant protection mutualisms appear to be routinely positive for plants, and only occasionally neutral.},

abstract = {The genus Greya is closely related to the yucca moths, and Greya species interact with their host plants in many of the same ways as yucca moths. Females both pollinate and oviposit in the flowers of their host. Unlike yucca moths, however, pollinating Greya species share flowers with co-pollinators that do not oviposit on the host. We studied the interaction between Greya politella (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) and Lithophragma parviflorum (Hook.) Torr. {\&} Gray (Saxifragaceae) to evaluate the effect on seed output of a pollinating seed parasite against a background of co- pollinators. Flowers were visited and pollinated mostly by bombyliid flies, solitary bees, and G. politella. Bombyliid flies alone composed 68-88{\%} of the 5522 visits recorded over 2 yr. Although both male and female G. politella visited the flowers and probed for nectar, pollination by this species occurred only as females oviposited through the corolla tube, thereby passively transferring to the stigma pollen adhering to the abdomen. Visitation to flowers by all pollinators averaged 0.3-1.9 visits/h during daylight hours. Consequently, most flowers were visited multiple times during the several days that stigmas were receptive, and 77{\%} of the flowers tagged during the 4 yr had some developing seeds. Pollination did not depend upon visitation by G. politella. Flowers receiving G. politella eggs had the same probability of producing some seed and the same mean number of developing seeds as flowers visited only by other insects. Most flowers received the eggs of only one G. politella female, and the larvae ate 15-27{\%} of the developing seeds. The final number of mature seeds remaining in attacked flowers did not differ from unattacked flowers except at one site in 1 yr, in which the values for attacked plants were marginally lower. Other sources of variation affecting seed output masked the effects of seed consumption by Greya. Overall, G. politella females have the potential to be mutualistic with L. parviflorum: they are effective pollinators, generally visit most plants and about half the flowers in the population, and impose a fairly small cost on seed output. Nonetheless, the abundant and effective co- pollinators, which do not eat the developing seeds, swamp Greya's mutualistic effects. Under the current conditions at Granite Point, the relationship between G. politella and L. parviflorum may be mostly commensalistic. The evolution of specialization to G. politella as an exclusive pollinator would seem to be possible only in L. parviflorum populations in which effective co-pollinators were either rare or unpredictable. That is, the potential for the evolution of specificity in this mutualism appears to depend upon the community context in which the interaction takes place rather than upon the simple outcome of the pairwise interaction between Greya and Lithophragma.},

In experiments with paired Cupania vernalis (Sapindaceae) saplings in a semi-deciduous forest in south-east Brazil, we blocked leaf domatia to examine their effect: (1) on mites and other arthropods, and (2) on damage caused by fungi and herbivorous arthropods. In general, plants with resin-blocked domatia had fewer predaceous mites on leaves than control plants with unaltered domatia, but the total abundances of fungivorous and of phytophagous mites remained unchanged. However, phytophagous eriophyid mites, the most numerous inhabitants of domatia, decreased on leaf surfaces with the blocking treatment. In a second experiment, treated plants lacking functional domatia developed significantly greater numbers and areas of chlorosis, apparently due to increased eriophyid attacks, whereas fungal attack, epiphyll abundance and leaf-area loss were unaffected. This seems to be the first experimental study to demonstrate that leaf domatia can benefit plants against herbivory in a natural system. The possible stabilizing effect of leaf domatia on predator-prey interactions is discussed.},

abstract = {Aim Geographical variation in parasite diversity is examined among populations of fish in their original heartland and in areas where they have been introduced. The diversity in heartland and introduced populations is contrasted, and also compared with the expectations of a null model. Location Data on the parasite communities of two salmonid fish species were obtained: the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in its British Columbia heartland and in introduced populations in North America, Great Britain, South America and New Zealand; and the brown trout Salmo trutta in heartland populations from Great Britain, and in introduced populations in North America, South America and New Zealand. Methods The average taxonomic distinctness and its variance were computed for each parasite community, and used as measures of the taxonomic diversity of parasite species in each fish population. Observed values of taxonomic distinctness were also compared with those expected if each community was a random selection from the world list of parasite species known for each of the two host species. Results Few parasite communities departed from the expectations of the null model, i.e. few had a taxonomic diversity of parasites greater or lower than that expected from a random selection of parasite species. However, these departures were not more or less likely among heartland fish populations than among introduced ones. In both fish species, parasite communities in introduced populations tended to be a little more taxonomically diverse than in the heartland populations. Main conclusions Overall, the results suggest that the accumulation of parasite species in introduced hosts over short (ecological) periods of time can result in parasite assemblages that are just as, or even more, taxonomically diverse than those developed over much longer (evolutionary) time frames in the host species geographical heartland. This finding highlights the importance of ecological factors in parasite biodiversity in addition to coevolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Avian seed dispersal mutualisms are characterized frequently by stochastic interactions between birds and fruits; however, many studies report coarse-scale correlations in annual abundances of birds and fruits at particular locales (i.e. 'phenological synchrony'). This study tested the geographical consistency of phenological synchrony in a meta-analysis of data from 14 biogeographic locations. Data from a single site in British Columbia, Canada, were then used to test the dispersal facilitation hypothesis, which postulates that synchronous bird-fruit abundance patterns result from deterministic seed dispersal processes (i.e. avian fruit consumption). Results showed that phenological synchrony is a geographically consistent pattern. However, fruit production occurred after peak periods of bird abundances in British Columbia. Although phenological patterns were asynchronous at this site, observational and experimental fruit removal patterns supported the dispersal facilitation hypothesis. Avian fruit consumption covaried with bird abundances, suggesting selection may favour earlier fruit production and increased phenological synchrony. Environmental data suggest that earlier fruit production is constrained by cold spring temperatures, which inhibit the activity of pollinators and earlier dates of fruit maturation. Overall, the results show that phenological synchrony is a geographically consistent pattern in seed dispersal mutualisms. However, decoupled bird-fruit abundance patterns may occur despite deterministic processes favouring phenological synchrony.},

It is accompanied by an increase in daily food intake and food utilisation efficiency and by a seasonal shift in food selection. In particular, seasonal frugivory appears to play a key role in many migrants. Fruits have a high content of fatty acids indispensable for building up the specific depot lipids. In addition, plant secondary compounds seem to play some kind of supportive role, but the mechanisms are not yet known. The effect of being fat on the metabolic situation in migrant birds appears to be similar to the metabolic syndrome in obese humans.

abstract = {The primary aim of this paper is to discuss the methodological approaches that may best develop studies of allelopathy in the future. Laboratory studies on the functions of isolated chemicals, no matter how mechanistically detailed, cannot demonstrate the significance of allelopathy in communities. Evidence for allelopathy in natural plant communities should include information of concentrations and release rates such as demonstrated in field soils for (+/-)- catechin and Centaurea maculosa Lam. Community-relevant evidence for allelopathy should include some manipulation of exudates such as performed in many experiments with activated carbon and gel filtration columns. Realistic evidence for allelopathy should include separation of resource effects from chemical effects; such as demonstrated by experiments with activated carbon additions, density-dependent responses to additions of competitors and chemicals, and resource addition treatments. Community-relevant evidence should link laboratory effects to field patterns and experiments; such as the links between the inhibitory effects of roots of Larrea tridentata Cov., the highly spatially segregated root systems and regular above-ground spacing of this species, strong spatial disassociation of L. tridentata with other species, and removal experiments indicating that segregation of L. tridentata root systems via allelopathy may feed back to sequestering of resource use. Studies of allelopathy should consider chemically initiated shifts in microbial populations, and the effects of organic and inorganic soil components on the function of exudates; which has been done in a number of studies. Finally, studies of allelopathy should include large-scale manipulation of chemical effects; such as performed in field experiments in boreal forests in Sweden with Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Demonstrating the occurrence and importance of chemically mediated interactions among plants is not trivial. If even a small portion of the thousands of chemicals produced by different plant species have effects on their neighbours, then species-specific interactions, natural selection, community integration, and community coevolution may be quite different than predicted by conceptual models based solely on resource competition. Appropriate methodology is crucial for integrating chemically mediated interactions into ecological theory.},

Their ecological success is thought to depend largely on the evolutionary alignment of reproductive interests between ants and fungi after vertical transmission and the ancient suppression of fungal sexuality. In the present study we test these assumptions and provide the first evidence of recombination in attine cultivars, contradicting widely held perceptions of obligate clonality. In addition, we document long-distance horizontal transmission of symbionts between leaf-cutter ant species on mainland Central America and South America and those endemic to Cuba, suggesting both lack of pairwise coevolutionary specificity in ant/cultivar interactions and dispersal of symbionts independent of their ant hosts. The coevolution between leaf-cutters and their fungal symbionts is thus not reciprocally pairwise. Rather, a single widespread and sexual fungal symbiont species is engaged in multiple interactions with divergent ant lineages. Strict fungal clonality and vertical transmission evidently have not played a critical role in the long-term evolutionary or ecological success of this well known mutualism.},

Effects of natural and experimental herbivory on the stage and size of reproductive plants were measured. Both the frequency and timing of herbivory varied across T. grandiflorum populations. Reproductive plants were more likely to regress to nonreproductive stages in the next growing season when (1) reproductive plants were consumed by deer (vs. intact reproductive plants); (2) reproductive plants were consumed early in the growing season (vs. reproductive plants consumed late in the growing season); (3) reproductive plants were smaller in size. Clipped plants that remained reproductive were smaller in the following season than unclipped controls. Plant size was positively correlated with the number of ovules, suggesting that reductions in the growth rate of reproductive plants diminish their future reproductive success. Populations with high levels of natural herbivory had a greater proportion of reproductive plants that regressed to nonreproductive stages, probably because reproductive plants in these populations were smaller in size.

abstract = {AbstractKey advances are being made on the structures of predator-prey food webs and competitive communities that enhance their stability, but little attention has been given to such complexity-stability relationships for mutualistic communities. We show, by way of theoretical analyses with empirically informed parameters, that structural properties can alter the stability of mutualistic communities characterized by nonlinear functional responses among the interacting species. Specifically, community resilience is enhanced by increasing community size (species diversity) and the number of species interactions (connectivity), and through strong, symmetric interaction strengths of highly nested networks. As a result, mutualistic communities show largely positive complexity-stability relationships, in opposition to the standard paradox. Thus, contrary to the commonly-held belief that mutualism's positive feedback destabilizes food webs, our results suggest that interplay between the structure and function of ecological networks in general, and consideration of mutualistic interactions in particular, may be key to understanding complexity-stability relationships of biological communities as a whole.},

abstract = {Predators can reduce herbivory by consuming herbivores (a consumptive effect) and by altering herbivore behavior, life history, physiology or distribution (non-consumptive effects). The non-consumptive; or trait-mediated, effects of predators on prey may have important functions in the dynamics of communities. In a facultative ant-plant mutualism, we investigated whether these non-consumptive effects influenced the host plants of prey. Here, predaceous ants (Forelius pruinosus) consume and disturb a dominant lepidopteran folivore (Bucculatrix thurberiella) of wild cotton plants (Gossypium thurberi). Season-long ant exclusion experiments revealed that ants had a larger proportional effect on damage by B. thurberiella than on caterpillar abundance, a result that suggests ants have a strong non-consumptive effect. Behavioral experiments conducted in two populations over 2 years demonstrated that B. thurberiella caterpillars were substantially less likely to damage wild cotton leaves in the presence of ants due to ant-induced changes in caterpillar behavior. In the absence of ants caterpillars spent more time stationary (potential feeding time) and less time dropping from leaves by a thread of silk than when ants were present. Furthermore, ants altered the spatial distribution of both caterpillars and damage; caterpillars spent relatively more time on the upper surfaces of leaves and caused damage further from the leaf margin in ant exclusion treatments. Both direct encounters with ants and information conveyed when ants walked onto leaves were key events leading to the antipredator behaviors of caterpillars. This study contributes to a small body of evidence from terrestrial systems demonstrating that the trait-mediated effects of predators can cascade to the host plants of prey.},

To assess the effectiveness of extrafloral nectaries (EFN) as a defensive mechanism of plants it is vital to use a multiple interactions approach and assess the contribution of all visiting species and their interactions.2. The effect of EFN-visiting ants (Camponotus planatus, C . abdominalis, Conomyrma sp., Crematogaster brevispinosa, Forelius sp., Pseudomyrmex sp.) and wasps (Polistes instabilis, Polybia occidentalis ) on the reproductive success (estimated as the number of reproductive structures) of Turnera ulmifolia (Turneraceae) was experimentally evaluated. Herbivory effects were tested using Euptoieta hegesia larvae (caterpillars), which is the main herbivore of this plant. The study was done in a coastal sand dune scrub in Veracruz, Mexico.3. Wasps and ants were selectively excluded using a two-factor design (Wasps, Ants) block design, both factors with two levels (absent, present). The response variables were an index of herbivory per branch and the number of buds, flowers, ripe and unripe fruit per plant, and the seed/fruit ratio per branch.4. After a week of placing the larvae on experimental plants, they were significantly more frequent on plants where wasps and ants had been experimentally excluded.5. Wasp presence was associated significantly with greater numbers of buds, flowers, ripe fruit and seeds. When acting separately, wasps and ants exerted a positive effect in decreasing herbivory levels and increasing the number of unripe fruit; when acting together, however, their effect was not additive.6. This is the first demonstration of a positive effect on the plant by wasps associated with EFN. The ecological implication of this finding is that the function of EFN and the ultimate effects on a plant will probably depend on the array of organisms visiting its EFN.},

There is little empirical evidence indicating which mode is more common, in part, we believe, because of an absence of explicit criteria by which the two modes can be distinguished. We present such a criterion, which states that, for selection imposed by different herbivores to be independent (pairwise coevolution), not only must there be no genetic correlation among plant resistances to the different species of herbivores, but also there must be no ecological interactions whereby one herbivore affects the evolution of resistance to other species. We present a model that demonstrates the validity of this criterion. We tested whether this criterion is satisfied by the annual morning glory Ipomoea purpurea and two of its insect herbivores, Deloyala guttata and Bedellia somnulentella, by conducting both greenhouse and field experiments. We placed various densities of the two insect species on plants in a factorial design and tested for a statistical interaction between densities of the two species on plant fitness. We did not detect an interaction in either experiment. Our results suggest, therefore, that selection exerted by insect herbivores on resistance in I. purpurea is pairwise rather than diffuse.},

One potential explanation is that changes in the community composition alter the coevolutionary interactions between species, but little evidence exists regarding the occurrence of such changes. Here we present evidence that the pattern of natural selection on plant defence traits, and the probable response to that selection, are critically dependent on the composition of the biotic community. The evolutionary trajectory of defence traits against mammalian herbivory in the Ivy leaf morning glory (Ipomoea hederacea), and which defence traits are likely to respond to selection, are both dependent on the presence or absence of insect herbivores. These results indicate that variation in community composition may be a driving force in generating geographical mosaics.},

abstract = {Herbivore alteration of litter inputs may change litter decomposition rates and influence ecosystem nutrient cycling. In a semiarid woodland at Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, long-term insect herbivore removal experiments and the presence of herbivore resistant and susceptible pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) have allowed characterization of the population- and community-level effects of herbivory. Here we report how these same two herbivores, the mesophyll-feeding scale insect Matsucoccus acalyptus and the stem-boring moth Dioryctria albovittella alter litter quality, dynamics, and decomposition in this ecosystem. We measured aboveground litterfall, litter chemical composition, and first-year litter decomposition rates for trees resistant and susceptible to both herbivores and for susceptible trees from which herbivores had been experimentally removed for 16-18 years. Both herbivores significantly increased nitrogen concentration and decreased lignin:nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen ratios of aboveground litter. Herbivory by scale insects also increased litter phosphorus concentration and annual needle litterfall mass. Consistent with its increased chemical quality, litter from herbivore-susceptible trees decomposed more rapidly in the first year. These results suggest that herbivory may increase nutrient cycling rates in this system by altering the chemical quality of litter, a mechanism that augments the nutrient acceleration hypothesis. The distribution of trees resistant and susceptible to the two herbivores at our site, and their associated variation in litter quality and decomposition, likely creates a mosaic of litter quality and nutrient cycling rates at the landscape scale. Further, because the differences in litter quality are associated with tree resistance and susceptibility traits, our findings are among the first to establish that intraspecific genetic variation may affect ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Herbivory is a fundamental process that controls primary producer abundance and regulates energy and nutrient flows to higher trophic levels. Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding of the factors that control consumer regulation of vascular plants in aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plant–herbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes in plant abundance would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes in plant abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions in plant abundance than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions in plant abundance than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions in plant abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change in plant abundance, with the strongest reductions in plant abundance reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions in plant abundance. Finally, we found that herbivore–plant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions in plant abundance compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions in plant abundance compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivore–plant nativeness on changes in plant abundance were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions in aquatic plant abundance are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plant–herbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants.},

abstract = {Foragers typically attempt to consume food resources that offer the greatest energy gain for the least cost, switching between habitats as the most profitable food resource changes over time. Optimal foraging models require accurate data on the gains and costs associated with each food resource to successfully predict temporal shifts. Whilst previous studies have shown that seasonal changes in food quantity and quality can drive habitat shifts, few studies have shown the effects on habitat choice of seasonal changes in metabolic foraging costs. In this study we combined field and literature data to construct an optimal foraging model to examine the effect of seasonal changes in food quantity, food quality and foraging costs on the timing of a switch from terrestrial to aquatic habitat by non-breeding mute swans (Cygnus olor) in a shallow river catchment. Feeding experiments were used to quantify the functional response of swans to changes in aquatic plant biomasses. By sequentially testing alternative models with fixed or variable values for food quantity, food quality and foraging cost, we found that we needed to include seasonal variance in foraging costs in the model to accurately predict the observed habitat switch date. However, we did not need to include seasonal variance in food quantity and food quality, as accurate predictions could be obtained with fixed values for these two parameters. Therefore, the seasonal changes in foraging costs were the key factor influencing the behavioural decision to switch feeding habitats. These seasonal changes in foraging costs were driven by changes in water velocity; the profitability of aquatic foraging was negatively related to water velocity, as faster water required more energy to be expended in swimming. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating seasonal variation in foraging costs into our understanding of the foraging decisions of animals.},

abstract = {Interactions with animals are potentially important in shaping the life histories of plants. However, we still largely lack the quantitative information that is necessary to compare plant-animal interactions and plant life histories. This is because most studies have focused on only a single interaction and a single component of fitness. This review suggests a protocol for how plant-animal interactions, as well as other, interactions can be quantitatively investigated.I review results from the forest herb Lathyrus vernus to examine how plant performance is influenced by mollusc damage of shoot buds, vertebrate grazing, leaf damage, pre-dispersal seed predation, flower herbivory and pollinator visitation. More specifically I ask: (1) What are the effects of these interactions on components of plant fitness? (2) How do such effects translate into total fitness? (3) Do trade-offs among components of plant fitness influence the net effect of animals? (4) Are antagonistic and mutualistic interactions influenced by the same plant traits?The results illustrate why it is often necessary to monitor plants over several seasons and over all life cycle phases to assess the total effects of environmental factors. In L. vernus many components of fitness were affected by multiple interactions with animals. A large proportion of these effects was carried over to subsequent seasons and could only be detected after one or two seasons. Assessing the effects on overall performance in perennial plants is particularly difficult because fitness components have very different influence on total fitness. The matrix model approach used to estimate the effect of herbivores, seed predators and pollinators on L. vernus provides one possible way to make such assessments for organisms with complex life cycles. The results show that the cryptic damage of emerging shoots has the largest negative effects on total fitness. Correlations between different components are an essential feature of many life histories and must be incorporated into demographic models if we want to assess the net effect of environmental factors. In L. vernus costs of reproduction were present and demographic modelling showed that the positive effects of an increased seed production after additional hand-pollination on total fitness was completely offset by poorer performance in the following year.Lastly, this study provides an example of how optimal trait values can be assessed when traits influence several fitness components and several interactions. In L. vernus a higher number of flowers was correlated to both an increased fruit set and an increased risk of grazing damage and these effects were, in turn, carried over to the next season. The results clearly illustrate the limitations of inferences about phenotypic selection pressures that are based on single fitness components or single interactions.Taken together the results for L. vernus show that the selective pressure constituted by a given amount of animal interference is highly dependent on the context, in terms of both plant life history and other interactions. A life cycle approach like the one outlined in this study may avoid several problems and provide the basis for assessments of the total effects of animals on plants. Such an approach must be based on in-depth studies of plants.},

Here, we review the evidence for criteria identified to detect community-based, diffuse coevolution. These criteria include (a) the presence of genetic correlations between traits involved in multiple interactions, (b) interactions with one species that alter the likelihood or intensity of interactions with other species, and (c) nonadditive combined effects of multiple interactors. In addition, we review the evidence that multispecies interactions have demographic consequences for populations, as well as evolutionary consequences. Finally, we explore the experimental and analytical techniques, and their limitations, used in the study of multispecies interactions. Throughout, we discuss areas in particular need of future research.},

Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks. especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant-pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical-tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (1) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: In I = 0.575 + 0.61 In M; R-2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible. decreased exponentially with species richness, the SLIM of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[-0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland ({\textgreater}1500 in elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and tropical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species. A : P. compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction buildup as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.},

This happens in the family Sapotaceae the fruits of which often simultaneously show both characteristics, and which is the dominant family in this monkey's diet, at the Nourague Station. We also observed that the howler monkey and probably other frugivorous primates like the Spider Monkey (Ateles paniscus), is one of the main consumers and dispersers of Sapotaceae in our study site. An analysis of seedling populations under sleeping sites of howler monkeys indicates that they could be considered as efficient dispersers for this plant family. Moreover, the aggregative pattern of seed dispersal by howlers could be at the origin of the clumped distribution of most Sapotaceae. All these observations enable us to hypothesise the occurrence of a {\textless}{\textless}diffuse coevolution{\textgreater}{\textgreater} between primates and fruits of the Sapotaceae.},

We tested this prediction in rainforest in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania, by using the endemic tree Leptonychia usambarensis (Sterculiaceae) and birds that disperse its seeds. We investigated bird abundance and Leptonychia dispersal ecology in fragments isolated for {\textgreater}70 yr, as compared with 3,500 ha of continuous forest. Birds that dispersed Leptonychia seeds in continuous forest were rare or absent in small fragments, where fewer seeds were removed from each tree, far fewer seedlings occurred {\textgreater}10 m from parent trees, and far more seedlings occurred in dense aggregations under parental crowns. Overall, our samples showed that fewer juvenile Leptonychia recruited in fragments than in continuous forest. We provide solid evidence that deficient dispersal due to habitat fragmentation seriously impacts the reproductive cycle of a tropical bird-dispersed tree.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary models of the interactions between fruiting plants and avian seed dispersers have been influenced by the assumption that regurgitation and defecation of seeds have diffferent effects on seed coats, and consequently seed germination. We evaluated how the manner of seed processing affects seed germination by feeding fruits of three bird-dispersed shrubs, spicebush (Lindera benzoin), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), to captive cedar waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) and thrushes (Turdus migratorius, Hylocichla mustelina, Catharus guttatus and C. minimus).Cedar waxwings defecate all seeds, whereas thrushes regurgitate most seeds. For all three shrub species and all five bird species, there were no differences in germination success between seeds manually cleaned of pulp, and cleaned, bird-passed seeds, regardless of whether seeds were regurgitated or defecated. However, seeds of Lindera, and Prunus that were defecated by cedar waxwings and planted with feces, mimicking the depositional environment of defecated seeds in nature, suffered reduced germination relative to cleaned seeds. Thus, our results do not suggest that whether seeds are regurgitated or defecated is an important component of dispersal quality because of direct effects on the seed coat. Instead, seed processing modes differed in their effects on seed germination because of the feces associated with defecated seeds. Removal of fruit pulp from seeds by frugivores, a fundamental consequence of dispersal in animal guts, was critical for germination, especially for seeds within the lipid-rich fruits of Lindera and Viburnum. This suggests that for some fruiting plants, frugivores procide an essential service by freeing seeds from fruit pulp, in addition to their role in seed dispersal.},

We investigated genetic variation for inducibility of defensive traits in wild radish plants and asked if the evolution of induction is constrained by costs of phenotypic plasticity. In a greenhouse experiment using paternal half-sibling families, we show additive genetic variation for plasticity in glucosinolate concentration. Genetic variation for glucosinolates was not detected in undamaged plants, but was significant following herbivory by a specialist herbivore, Pieris rapae. On average, damaged plants had 55{\%} higher concentrations of glucosinolates compared to controls. In addition, we found significant narrow-sense heritabilities for leaf size, trichome number, flowering phenology, and lifetime fruit production. In a second experiment, we found evidence of genetic variation in induced plant resistance to P. rapae. Although overall there was little evidence for genetic correlations between the defensive and life-history traits we measured, we show that more plastic families had lower fitness than less plastic families in the absence of herbivory (i.e., evidence for genetic costs of plasticity). Thus, there is genetic variation for induction of defense in wild radish, and the evolution of inducibility may be constrained by costs of plasticity.; },

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The economic importance of grapevine has driven significant efforts in genomics to accelerate the exploitation of Vitis resources for development of new cultivars. However, although a large number of clonally propagated accessions are maintained in grape germplasm collections worldwide, their use for crop improvement is limited by the scarcity of information on genetic diversity, population structure and proper phenotypic assessment. The identification of representative and manageable subset of accessions would facilitate access to the diversity available in large collections. A genome-wide germplasm characterization using molecular markers can offer reliable tools for adjusting the quality and representativeness of such core samples.RESULTS:We investigated patterns of molecular diversity at 22 common microsatellite loci and 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2273 accessions of domesticated grapevine V. vinifera ssp. sativa, its wild relative V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris, interspecific hybrid cultivars and rootstocks. Despite the large number of putative duplicates and extensive clonal relationships among the accessions, we observed high level of genetic variation. In the total germplasm collection the average genetic diversity, as quantified by the expected heterozygosity, was higher for SSR loci (0.81) than for SNPs (0.34). The analysis of the genetic structure in the grape germplasm collection revealed several levels of stratification. The primary division was between accessions of V. vinifera and non-vinifera, followed by the distinction between wild and domesticated grapevine. Intra-specific subgroups were detected within cultivated grapevine representing different eco-geographic groups. The comparison of a phenological core collection and genetic core collections showed that the latter retained more genetic diversity, while maintaining a similar phenotypic variability.CONCLUSIONS:The comprehensive molecular characterization of our grape germplasm collection contributes to the knowledge about levels and distribution of genetic diversity in the existing resources of Vitis and provides insights into genetic subdivision within the European germplasm. Genotypic and phenotypic information compared in this study may efficiently guide further exploration of this diversity for facilitating its practical use.},

The benefits to plants of dispersal of their seeds in this way have been well documented, but the benefits to the ants from consuming the elaiosomes have rarely been measured and are less clear. Ant benefits from myrmecochory were investigated in a laboratory experiment using the ant Myrmica ruginodis and seeds of Ulex species. To separate the effects of elaiosome consumption on the development of newly produced larvae versus existing larvae, ten 'Queenright' colonies containing a queen were compared to ten 'Queenless' colonies. Six measures of colony fitness over a complete annual cycle were taken: sexual production, larval weight and number, pupal weight and number, and worker survival. Queenless colonies fed with elaiosomes produced 100.0 +/- 29.3 (mean +/- SE) of larvae compared to non-elaiosome fed colonies which produced 49.6 +/- 19.0; an increase of 102{\%}. Larval weight increased in both Queenright and Queenless colonies. In colonies fed with elaiosomes, larvae weighed 1.02 +/- 0.1 mg, but in non-elaiosome fed colonies larvae weighed 0.69 +/- 0.1 mg; an increase of 48{\%}. The food supplement provided by Ulex elaiosomes was trivial in energetic terms, under the conditions of an ample diet, suggesting that these effects might be due to the presence of essential nutrients. Chemical analysis of Ulex elaiosomes showed the presence of four essential fatty acids and four essential sterols for ants.},

abstract = {Traits associated with plant tolerance to herbivory are often thought to be those involved in resource acquisition, e.g., root biomass, leaf area, and photosynthetic rate. Plant resistance traits, like concentrations of secondary compounds, can also be negatively associated with tolerance. Few studies have,measured both 'tolerance' and 'resistance' traits in the same study to determine which are the best predictors of a plant's ability to tolerate insect,damage. Here, we measured simultaneously a large suite of traits on damaged and undamaged siblings in 10 families of greenhouse-grown Raphanus raphanistrum plants. Traits measured were: leaf area, root biomass, shoot biomass, photosynthetic rate, trichome density, total glucosinolate concentration, flowering rate, petal size, total number of flowers, and total number of seeds. Pieris rapae larvae were used to damage plants to 50{\%} leaf area removal. Using multiple regression, we examined which traits were the best. predictors of tolerance. We considered both male tolerance (relative number of flowers produced by damaged and undamaged sibs) and female tolerance (relative number of seeds produced). We found that, generally, resistance traits were better predictors of both male and female tolerance than tolerance traits. Interestingly, we found that mate and female tolerance were not correlated, and that male tolerance was significantly less variable than female tolerance. We also found that measurements, of traits postdamage (induced state) were more informative than measurements on undamaged plants (constitutive state). Our results support the idea of a resistance/tolerance trade-off. In addition, our study suggests that there are conflicts in investment in male. vs. female fitness after damage.},

abstract = {Pollinator attraction, pollen limitation, resource limitation, pollen donation and selective fruit abortion have all been proposed as processes explaining why hermaphroditic plants commonly produce many more flowers than mature fruit. We conducted a series of experiments in Arizona to investigate low fruit-to-flower ratios in senita cacti, which rely exclusively on pollinating seed-consumers. Selective abortion of fruit based on seed predators is of particular interest in this case because plants relying on pollinating seed-consumers are predicted to have such a mechanism to minimize seed loss. Pollinator attraction and pollen dispersal increased with flower number, but fruit set did not, refuting the hypothesis that excess flowers increase fruit set by attracting more pollinators. Fruit set of natural- and hand-pollinated flowers were not different, supporting the resource, rather than pollen, limitation hypothesis. Senita did abort fruit, but not selectively based on pollen quantity, pollen donors, or seed predators. Collectively, these results are consistent with sex allocation theory in that resource allocation to excess flower production can increase pollen dispersal and the male fitness function of flowers, but consequently results in reduced resources available for fruit set. Inconsistent with sex allocation theory, however, fruit production and the female fitness function of flowers may actually increase with flower production. This is because excess flower production lowers pollinator-to-flower ratios and results in fruit abortion, both of which limit the abundance and hence oviposition rates, of pre-dispersal seed predators.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals associate with a diverse array of eukaryotic and noneukaryotic microbes. Best known are dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium ("zooxanthellae"), which are photosynthetic symbionts found in all reef-building corals. Once considered a single species, they are now recognized as several large, genetically diverse groups that often co-occur within a single host species or colony. Variation among Symbiodinium in host identities, tolerance to stress, and ability to colonize hosts has been documented, but there is little information on the ecology of zooxanthellar free-living stages and how different zooxanthellae perform as partners. Other microbial associates of reef corals are much less well known, but studies indicate that individual coral colonies host diverse assemblages of bacteria, some of which seem to have species-specific associations. This diversity of microbial associates has important evolutionary and ecological implications. Most mutualisms evolve as balanced reciprocations that allow partners to detect cheaters, particularly when partners are potentially diverse and can be transmitted horizontally. Thus, environmental stresses that incapacitate the ability of partners to reciprocate can destabilize associations by eliciting rejection by their hosts. Coral bleaching (the loss of zooxanthellae) and coral diseases, both increasing over the last several decades, may be examples of stress-related mutualistic instability.},

A literature review including 51 plant species from 28 families found that the often-measured scarification effect (germination of bird-defecated vs hand-cleaned seeds) is significantly smaller than the rarely-measured deinhibition effect (germination of hand-cleaned seeds vs those in intact fruits). 3. Both the literature review and new experimental data show that germination conditions affect germination. In particular, seeds in intact fruits have much lower germination percentages in Petri dishes than in the field. Poor germination from intact fruits in Petri dishes may be an artefact. 4. A field experiment with three New Zealand species showed variable effects of non-removal of the fruit pericarp. The retention of the pericarp had no effect on germination in Nestegis cunninghamii; increased the proportion of seeds entering dormancy in Melicytus lanceolatus; and greatly increased seed mortality in Pennantia corymbosa. 5.

We used fecal analysis, a constant-effort trapping scheme and field observations to estimate the extent of frugivory, and bird habitat and microhabitat selection with regard to natural fruit and foliage densities. We also measured bird microhabitat selection in a set of fruit-manipulated trees. We trapped a total of 2,357 birds during the course of the study. Although sylviids exhibited higher frugivory level than turdids, both species groups exhibited a similar significantly positive correlation between bird and fruit densities at the habitat scale. However, at the microhabitat scale, sylviids selected densely foliated trees, whilst turdids were randomly distributed among trees. Our findings suggest that both species groups selected fruit-rich stopover habitats to take advantage of the high food availability before the demanding migration journey. No other mechanism except predation avoidance can explain the sylviids' microhabitat selection; the migrants used foliage cover to reduce bird detectability by raptors. We conclude that en route passerines may use staging habitats in a sophisticated manner, by adopting scale-related behavior with regard to the availability of food and refuge cover.},

We show how a deceptive orchid (Disa nivea) successfully exploits a reciprocally specialized mutualism between a nectar-producing plant (Zaluzianskya microsiphon) and its long-proboscid fly pollinator (Prosoeca gang/baueri). Disa nivea is a rare southern African orchid known only from habitats that support large populations of Z. microsiphon, which it closely resembles in both general morphology and floral spectral reflectance. Significant covariation in floral traits of Z. microsiphon and D. nivea was detected among populations. Where mimics are uncommon, flies do not appear to discriminate between the flowers of the two species. Pollination success in D. nivea was much higher at a site with abundant Z. microsiphon plants than at a site where Z. microsiphon was rare. Exploitation of a highly specialized mutualism appears to demand a high degree of phenotypic resemblance to a rewarding model by a deceptive mimic, as exemplified by D. nivea. The majority of deceptive orchids, on the other hand, exploit relatively generalized pollination systems and thus require only a vague resemblance to rewarding plants in the community in order to attract pollinators.},

Because mutualisms generate resources, they can be exploited by individuals that reap the benefits of the interaction without paying any cost. The presence of such 'cheaters' may have important consequences, yet we are only beginning to understand how cheaters evolve from mutualists and how their evolution may be curtailed within mutualistic lineages. The yucca-yucca moth pollination mutualism is an excellent model in this context as there have been two origins of cheating from within the yucca moth lineage. We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers to examine genetic structure in a moth population where a cheater species is parapatric with a resident pollinator. The results revealed extensive hybridization between pollinators and cheaters.

abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate patterns of fruit eating and seed dispersal in monkeys and apes and draw an important distinction between 1) the ecological consequences of primates as seed dispersers and 2) the evolutionary implications of primates on the seed and fruit traits of the plant species they exploit. In many forest communities, primates act as both seed predators and seed dispersers and are likely to have an important ecological impact on patterns of forest regeneration and tree species diversity. Evidence from Kibale National Park, Uganda, and Manu National Park, Peru, as well as several other South American sites indicates that monkeys and apes display a wide range of fruit-processing behaviors, including spitting seeds, dropping seeds, masticating seeds, and swallowing seeds. Differences in consumer body size, diet, ranging patterns, and oral and digestive morphology result in different patterns in the distance and distribution of seeds from the parent plant. In the case of South American monkeys, for example, despite their relatively small body size, platyrrhines were found to exploit larger fruits and swallow larger seeds on average than did Old World monkeys and apes of the Kibale forest. We found little evidence to support the existence of a coevolutionary relationship between a single or set of primate dispersers and the particular plant species they disperse. This is due to variability in the manner in which monkeys and apes select fruits and treat seeds, the fact that many species of primates and nonprimates exploit and disperse the same fruit species, and the fact that extremely high levels of postdispersal seed, seedling, and sapling mortality serve to dilute the influence that any primate species may have on the recruitment of the next generation of adult trees. It is apparent that many primate lineages exhibit dental, digestive, and/or sensory adaptations that aid in the exploitation of particular food types and that many lineages of flowering plants have evolved characteristics of fruits and seeds that facilitate seed dispersal. However, in Light of currently available data, we argue that these represent evolutionary rather than more strictly defined coevolutionary relationships. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary interactions depend upon a phenotypic interface of traits in each species that mediate the outcome of interactions among individuals. These phenotypic interfaces usually involve performance traits, such as locomotion or resistance to toxins, that comprise an integrated suite of physiological, morphological and behavioral traits. The reciprocal selection from species interactions may act directly on performance, but it is ultimately the evolution of these underlying components that shape the patterns of coevolutionary adaptation in performance. Bridging the macroevolutionary patterns of coevolution to the ecological processes that build them therefore requires a way to dissect the phenotypic interface of coevolution and determine how specific components of performance in one species exert selection on complimentary components of performance in a second species. We present an approach for analyzing the strength of selection in a coevolutionary interaction where individuals interact at random, and for identifying which component traits of the phenotypic interface are critical to mediating coevolution. The approach is illustrated with data from a predator-prey arms race between garter snakes and newts that operates through the interface of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and resistance to it.},

abstract = {One approach to understanding how mutualisms function in community settings is to model well-studied pairwise interactions in the presence of the few species with which they interact most strongly. In nature, such species are often specialized antagonists of one or both mutualists. Hence, these models can also shed light on the problem of when and how mutualisms are able to persist in the face of exploitation. We used spatial stochastic simulations to model the ecological dynamics of obligate, species-specific mutualisms between plants and pollinating seed parasite insects (e.g., yuccas and yucca moths) in the presence of one of two obligate antagonist species: flower-feeding insects (florivores) or insects that parasitize seeds but fail to pollinate (exploiters). Our results suggest that mutualisms can persist surprisingly well in the presence of highly specialized antagonists but that they exhibit distinctly different temporal and spatial dynamics when antagonists are present. In our models, antagonists tend to induce oscillations in the mutualist populations. As the number of per capita visits by antagonists increase, the system's oscillatory dynamics become more extreme, finally leading to the extinction of one or more of the three species. When the antagonists exhibit high per capita visitation frequencies and long dispersal distances, significant spatial patchiness emerges within these tripartite interactions. We found surprisingly little difference between the ecological effects of florivores and exploiters, although in general florivores tended to drive themselves (and sometimes the mutualists) to extinction at parameter values at which the exploiters were able to persist. These theoretical results suggest several testable hypotheses regarding the ecological and evolutionary persistence of mutualisms. More broadly, they point to the critical importance of studying the dynamics of pairwise interactions in community contexts.},

None of these conditions were satisfied for the ivy leaf morning glory, Ipomoea hederacea, and its insect, fungal, and mammalian natural enemies with a quantitative genetics field experiment. A significant negative genetic correlation exists between resistance to deer and generalist insect herbivory that would preclude an independent response to selection. In addition, resistance loci under selection differ depending on the composition of the natural enemy community as indicated by genetic correlations between deer resistances in the presence and absence of other natural enemies that differ substantially from 1. Finally, selection on deer resistance depends on the presence or absence of insects; in the presence of insects, greater deer resistance is favored, but in the absence of insects, deer resistance is effectively neutral. These results indicate that the composition of the natural enemy community can alter both the pattern of selection and the likely response to selection of resistance traits.},

abstract = {Many plant populations reproduce synchronously over time. Hypotheses to explain reproductive synchrony have typically been based on evolutionary advantages of synchrony, such as increased pollination or decreased predation with increasing numbers of flowering plants, often referred to as economies of scale. We tested for decreased herbivory, increased fruit set, and decreased predation as evolutionary mechanisms driving synchronous reproduction in an iteroparous perennial plant, Astragalus scaphoides, at three semiarid sagebrush steppe sites in intermountain valleys of Idaho and Montana, USA. Reproduction was synchronous at all sites and significantly bimodal at two sites, but it was never as variable as distinctly mast-seeding plant species. Plants in all populations experienced at least one economy of scale: decreased inflorescence herbivory, increased fruit set, and/or decreased weevil seed predation with increasing flowering plant density. At two of three sites, these relationships were strong enough to increase expected geometric mean seed set. However, among-site differences in benefits and strength of synchrony were not concordant. In particular, the site with the strongest economy of scale and highest coefficient of variation (cv) was the least bimodal. We suggest that different mechanisms drive. cv and bimodality in this species, both of which contribute to overall synchrony. In addition to reflecting direct fitness benefits, synchrony may be at least partly an indirect consequence of individual-level reproductive constraints. Recent models have demonstrated that individual-level constraints can make bimodal, alternate-year flowering likely.},

Previous endeavors have aimed primarily at identifying conditions that promote the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms. We consider in a conceptual model also the reciprocal influence of color polymorphism on population processes and propose that polymorphism entails selective advantages that may promote the ecological success of polymorphic species. The model begins with an evolutionary branching event from mono- to polymorphic condition that, under the influence of correlational selection, is predicted to promote the evolution of physical integration of coloration and other traits (cf. multi-trait coevolution and complex phenotypes). We propose that the coexistence within a population of alternative ecomorphs with coadapted gene complexes promotes utilization of diverse environmental resources, population stability and persistence, colonization success, and range expansions, and enhances the evolutionary potential and speciation. Conversely, we predict polymorphic populations to be less vulnerable to environmental change and at lower risk of range contractions and extinctions compared with monomorphic populations. We offer brief suggestions as to how these falsifiable predictions may be tested.},

abstract = {Quantitative-genetic approaches have offered significant insights into phenotypic evolution. However, quantitative- genetic analyses fail to provide information about the evolutionary relevance of specific loci. One complex and ecologically relevant trait for plants is their resistance to herbivory because natural enemies can impose significant damage. To illustrate the insights of combined molecular and ecological research, we present the results of a field study mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance and tolerance to natural rabbit herbivory in the genetic model, Arabidopsis thaliana. Replicates of the Ler x Col recombinant inbred lines were planted into field sites simulating natural autumn and spring seasonal germination cohorts. Shortly after flowering, herbivores removed the main flowering inflorescence (apical meristem). We found several main-effect QTL for resistance within each seasonal cohort and significant QTL- season interactions, demonstrating that the loci underlying resistance to a single herbivore differ across seasonal environments. The presence of QTL x environment also shows that variation at specific loci is only available to selection in some environments. Despite significant among-line variance components, no QTL for tolerance were detected. The combined results of the quantitative-genetic and QTL analyses demonstrate that many loci of small effect underlie tolerance to damage by rabbits, and counter the hypothesis of locus- specific tradeoffs between resistance and tolerance. The results also provide insights as to the locus-specific nature of evolutionary constraints, i.e. some loci influence flowering time and resistance in both seasonal cohorts. Our results show how linking molecular-genetic tools with field studies in ecologically relevant settings can clarify the role of specific loci in the evolution of quantitative traits.},

abstract = {A major empirical approach in community ecology is to describe the
dynamics of a community by examining small subsets of species. Unfortunately,
interaction modifications, which cause pair-wise interaction coefficients
to depend on the presence or absence of additional species, can make
it difficult to predict the overall dynamics of species within a
community from experiments with pairs of species. In a similar fashion,
one of the major approaches in evolutionary ecology has been to describe
the likely evolutionary dynamics of a single species by focusing
on the selection imposed by a limited number of other species within
the community. However, recent work on diffuse coevolution indicates
that selection pressures due to one species can change in the presence
of other species. The magnitude of the difficulty that interaction
modifications and diffuse coevolution present for predicting ecological
and evolutionary dynamics is an unresolved question. Here we outline
the similarities and differences between the two topics, discuss
experimental and statistical approaches to studying them, and make
predictions about when ecological interaction modifications are likely
to cause diffuse coevolution. Since the currencies for interaction
modifications are usually fitness components such as growth, fecundity,
or survival, is it likely that these will translate into corresponding
differences in the relative fitness of individuals or genotypes,
and thus in general these two phenomena will occur together. We argue
that community ecologists and evolutionary ecologists will both benefit
from experiments that test for the effects of interaction modifications,
and that studies of the mechanisms driving interaction modifications
and diffuse coevolution (e.g., changes in behavior, nonlinear effects
on shared resources, genetic covariances) will aid our progress in
understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities.},

abstract = {Single species can have large effects on entire communities through habitat modification and facilitation. I tested the general hypothesis that the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora facilitates the establishment and persistence of New England cobble beach plant communities by modifying the shoreline environment. This community is dominated by halophytic forbs and is restricted to estuarine cobble beaches bordered by Spartina. Beds of Spartina can reduce mean water velocity by 50{\%} and maximum velocity by nearly an order of magnitude, and they can substantially stabilize the cobble substrate. Specifically, I determined the importance of five life history stages (seed supply, seed germination, seedling emergence, seedling establishment, and adult survival) and four factors (water velocity, substrate stability, herbivory, and soil quality) in limiting lateral plant distribution. A seed addition experiment demonstrated that seedlings could only emerge behind Spartina, suggesting that seedling emergence is the proximate life history stage limiting adult distribution. Seed germination and adult survival do not appear to be limiting stages, at least in an absolute sense. Although seed supply was much greater (similar to 10-100x) behind Spartina, a substantial number of seeds were caught in seed traps placed between beds, suggesting that seed supply also does not limit absolute plant distribution. These results are supported by the presence of seedlings buried below the substrate surface between beds at the time when seedlings are naturally emerging behind beds. A manipulative field experiment was performed to test the effects of substrate instability, soil quality, and herbivory on seedling emergence between beds. Seeds of two annual cobble beach species (Suaeda linearis and Salicornia europaea) were added to plots behind Spartina and also between beds with and without substrate stabilization manipulations. This treatment was designed to stabilize the substrate in a manner that would not affect water velocity and soil characteristics or prevent access by potential herbivores. When not buffered by Spartina, seedlings of both species were only able to emerge and survive when the substrate was artificially stabilized. These results indicate that Spartina alterniflora facilitates the establishment and persistence of cobble beach plant communities by stabilizing the substrate and enabling seedlings to emerge and survive.},

Yucca moths are the only documented pollinator of yuccas, and moth larvae feed solely on developing yucca seeds. The quality of pollination by a female moth affects larval survival because flowers receiving small amounts of pollen or self-pollen have a high abscission probability, and larvae die in abscised flowers. We tested the prediction that yucca moths primarily perform outcross pollinations by using fluorescent dye to track pollen dispersal in five populations of Y. filamentosa. Dye transfers within plants were common in all populations (mean +/- 1 SE, 55 +/- 3.0{\%}), indicating that moths frequently deposit self-pollen. Distance of dye transfers ranged from 0 to 50 m, and the mean number of flowering plants between the pollen donor and recipient was 5 (median = 0). suggesting that most pollen was transferred among near neighbors. A multilocus genetic estimate of outcrossing based on seedlings matured from open-pollinated fruits at one site was 94 +/- 6{\%} (mean +/- 1 SD). We discuss why moths frequently deposit self-pollen to the detriment of their offspring and compare the yucca-yucca moth interaction with other obligate pollinator mutualisms in which neither pollinator nor plant benefit from self-pollination.},

The bird species did not differ in the time they spent foraging on the plants. The number of fruits consumed in each visit differed among species and there was positive correlation between avian body mass and mean number of consumed fruits in these visits. The time spent on plants was positively correlated to the number of consumed fruits by Elaenia spp., Brown-crested Flycatcher, Myiarchus tyrannulus (Tyrannidae) and the Rufous-bellied Thrush, Turdus rufiventris (Muscicapidae).

abstract = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability [1-6]. However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7-9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.},

abstract = {Understanding and mitigating the impact of an ever-increasing population and global economic activity on tropical forests is one of the great challenges currently facing biologists, conservationists and policy makers. Tropical forests currently face obvious regional changes, both negative and positive, and uncertain global changes. Although deforestation rates have increased to unprecedented levels, natural secondary succession has reclaimed approximately 15{\%} of the area deforested during the 1990s. Governments have also protected 18{\%} of the remaining tropical moist forest; however, unsustainable hunting continues to threaten many keystone mammal and bird species. The structure and dynamics of old-growth forests appear to be rapidly changing, suggesting that there is a pantropical response to global anthropogenic forcing, although the evidence comes almost exclusively from censuses of tree plots and is controversial. Here, I address ongoing anthropogenic change in tropical forests and suggest how these forests might respond to increasing anthropogenic pressure.},

A total of 3.4 km(2) of the urban area on Hong Kong Island was surveyed for spontaneous and planted fig plants of reproductive size. The 1124 individuals included 14 species in four subgenera: seven native species (F. fistulosa, F. hirta, F. hispida, F. microcarap, F. pumila, F. subpisocarpa, and F. variegata), four of which were sometimes planted, one probably native (F. virens), one naturalizing species (F. religiosa), and five exotic species that occurred only in cultivation, two of which (F. altissima, F. rumphii) are pollinated and produce viable seeds. The native species in the two most common subgenera form distinct ecological guilds: those in subgenus Sycomorus bear large, many seeded, green or yellow figs and are bat-dispersed pioneers on exposed soil; those in subgenus Urostigma bear small, few-seeded, dark-purple figs and are largely bird-dispersed and epilithic. The density of potentially fruiting fig plants in the study area (2.3/ha) was within the range reported for tropical forests and between them they were visited by the entire urban frugivore fauna. This study shows the importance of the urban fig flora to urban wildlife and also highlights the risk of cultivated Ficus species becoming invasive, despite their obligate species-specific pollinator mutualisms.},

abstract = {Studies of seed dispersal mutualisms typically test for adaptive relationships between fruits and frugivores. Here, I take the opposite approach, and ask what relationships would be expected based on chance encounters between mutualists. I derived a simple null model to predict pair-wise relationships between fruit and frugivore species. I assumed that all frugivores had identical fruit preferences, but allowed for interspecific variation in plant abundances, frugivore abundances and fruit phenologies. Under these conditions, the number of visits each frugivore species makes to each plant species results from the product of plant abundances and frugivore abundances when each plant species produces fruit. I then tested null model predictions with observations in a temperate rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. I measured the abundance and phenology of seven bird-dispersed plant species, seasonal changes in the abundances of six avian frugivore species and 212 interactions between them. Empirical results were generally consistent with predictions, suggesting that relationships between birds and fruits are structured randomly. However, some variation in relationships between observations and predictions was observed, suggesting deterministic processes may also be important. Overall results illustrate that predictable relationships between fruit and frugivore species can result from random encounters between mutualists.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the manner in which genetic variation within a tree species affects associated communities and ecosystem processes across its entire range is important for understanding how geographic mosaics of genetic interactions might develop and support different communities. While numerous studies have investigated the community and ecosystem consequences of genetic variation at the hybrid cross type or genotype level within a species, none has investigated the community-level effects of intraspecific genetic variation across the geographic range of a widespread species. This is the scale at which geographic mosaics of coevolution are hypothesized to exist. Studies at this level are particularly important for foundation tree species, which typically support numerous microbial, fungal, plant, and animal communities. We studied genetic variation across eight geographical races of the forest tree Eucalyptus globulus representing its natural distribution across southeastern Australia. The study was conducted in a 15-year-old common garden trial based on families derived from single-tree open-pollinated seed collections from the wild. Neutral molecular genetic variation within E. globulus was also assessed and compared with genetic divergence in the phenotypic and community traits. Three major findings emerged. First, we found significant genetically based, hierarchical variation in associated communities corresponding to geographical races of E. globulus and families within races. Second, divergence in foliar communities at the racial level was associated with genetically based divergence in specific leaf morphological and chemical traits that have known defensive functions. Third, significant positive correlations between canopy community dissimilarity and both neutral molecular genetic and leaf quantitative genetic dissimilarity at the race level supported a genetic similarity rule. Our results argue that genetic variation within foundation tree species has the potential to be a significant driver of the geographical mosaics of variation typical of forest communities, which could have important ecological and evolutionary implications.},

abstract = {I investigated the effects of successional stage and micro-elevation on seedling establishment of Calophyllum brasiliense (Clusiaceae), a common canopy tree of seasonally flooded lowland forest along the Mand River meander zone in southeastern Peru. To compare seedling establishment between microhabitat types, I planted C brasiliense seeds in a fully crossed experimental design of three successional stages (early, mid, and mature) and two micro-elevations (levees and backwaters). Seedling establishment success in this study was affected by both successional stage and microelevation, but micro-elevation was most important in mid-successional habitats. In general, seedlings in early succession experienced better conditions than in mature forest; light levels were higher, herbivory lower, and seedling growth higher. In mid-successional forest, micro-elevation determined habitat quality; back-waters had higher light levels, lower herbivory, and higher seedling growth and survival than levees. Mid-successional backwaters were similar in quality to early successional forest for seedling establishment, while levees in that same successional stage were the poorest microhabitats for establishment. Although mid-successional backwaters are similar to early succession for seedling establishment, in the long run, seedlings that establish in mid-succession have a lower chance of reaching reproductive size before their habitat ages to mature forest than members of their cohort that established in early succession. I hypothesize that successful recruitment for C brasiliense in the Mand River meander system requires dispersal to early successional habitat.},

abstract = {A simple food chain model of community structure was used to evaluate the roles of bottom-up and top-down factors in a rocky intertidal community. Predictions of the model were modified to incorporate known variation in the strength of species interactions and nutrient delivery rates along a wave-exposure gradient. To test the predictions of the model, I manipulated nutrients and consumers in tide pools chiseled into mudstone benches at two sites that varied in degree of wave exposure. The pools were located in the mid-intertidal zone between similar to1 and 1.5 m above mean lower low water (MLLW), at Boiler Bay, Oregon, USA. The focal organisms were the benthic macroalgae acid mobile invertebrate herbivores that dominate naturally occurring tide pools at this site. I manipulated nutrient levels and the abundance of herbivores in these tide pools in a fully factorial randomized block design replicated six times at a wave-exposed and a wave-protected site. The experiment was maintained for two years (1994-1996). The abundances of herbivores and macroalgae were monitored in the spring, summer, and fall of each year. I measured primary productivity in the tide pools during the summer. Herbivores had a negative impact on algal abundance. The total effect of herbivory, and the efficiency of herbivores per se, on algal abundance was lower at the wave-exposed site. Nutrient additions had a positive effect on algal abundance, but this effect was reduced at the wave-exposed site. Nutrients also appeared to increase algal productivity, but only where herbivore abundance was low. Algal abundance patterns were generally consistent with model predictions For bottom-up, top-down, and hydrodynamic effects. In contrast to model predictions, herbivore abundance did not respond to the nutrient treatment. The decoupling of consumers from resource dynamics is interpreted to be the result of an herbivore preference for noncalcified seaweeds with higher potential growth rates. In wave-protected pools, where nutrients were most limiting and consumers were most efficient, seaweeds with the potential to translate elevated nutrient levels into growth had no effective refuge from consumers. The difference in scale between resource patches (tide pools) and the foraging range of the dominant herbivore, Tegula funebralis, may have augmented the ability of this herbivore to virtually exclude fleshy seaweeds from wave-protected pools. Expanding the domain of applicability of food chain models requires the incorporation of consumer preferences, variation in plant growth rates, environmental gradients, and differences in the relative scales of resource patches and Foraging ranges of consumers.},

abstract = {Although autumn leaf colours of deciduous trees have been shown to protect against photo-oxidative damage, they are sometimes seen as signals to pests and predators. Here I modify the coevolution hypothesis of autumn leaf colours. I suggest that much of the within-population variation in autumn leaf colours can be explained by differences in the allocation of resources to sexual reproduction. According to the novel hypothesis, reproductively active woody plants produce early and intense autumn leaf colours in order to protect seeds and other reproductive tissues from pests that lay eggs in the autumn. If many seeds mature at times of leaf senescence or during the next summer, a woody plant will reallocate plenty of nitrogen to seeds. If sucking insects reproduce on such hosts, their flightless offspring will suffer poor-quality food after the ripening of seeds. Before this, however, insects will probably concentrate around the ripening seeds to forage on nitrogen-rich veins. This will decline the quality and quantity of developing seeds. If, on the other hand, insects are able to recognize reproductively active plants while laying eggs in the autumn, both the insects and the plants benefit. The flightless offspring of insects feeds on plants that supply sufficiently nitrogen for longer than reproducing plants do, while these optimise their reproduction by avoiding pests, which also contributes to the abundance of specialist pests. Hence, I suppose that while physiological factors are the origin of autumnal colour changes of deciduous leaves, the visible cue utilized by insects has evolved several times to an honest signal that reveals the unsuitability of the potential host in the near future. The reproductive insurance hypothesis may help us to understand why bright autumn leaf colours are rare among herbaceous plants, and why plants at high altitudes and latitudes are often brightly coloured in autumn.},

abstract = {The primary aim of this paper is to discuss the methodological approaches that may best develop studies of allelopathy in the future. Laboratory studies on the functions of isolated chemicals, no matter how mechanistically detailed, cannot demonstrate the significance of allelopathy in communities. Evidence for allelopathy in natural plant communities should include information of concentrations and release rates such as demonstrated in field soils for (+/-)- catechin and Centaurea maculosa Lam. Community-relevant evidence for allelopathy should include some manipulation of exudates such as performed in many experiments with activated carbon and gel filtration columns. Realistic evidence for allelopathy should include separation of resource effects from chemical effects; such as demonstrated by experiments with activated carbon additions, density-dependent responses to additions of competitors and chemicals, and resource addition treatments. Community-relevant evidence should link laboratory effects to field patterns and experiments; such as the links between the inhibitory effects of roots of Larrea tridentata Cov., the highly spatially segregated root systems and regular above-ground spacing of this species, strong spatial disassociation of L. tridentata with other species, and removal experiments indicating that segregation of L. tridentata root systems via allelopathy may feed back to sequestering of resource use. Studies of allelopathy should consider chemically initiated shifts in microbial populations, and the effects of organic and inorganic soil components on the function of exudates; which has been done in a number of studies. Finally, studies of allelopathy should include large-scale manipulation of chemical effects; such as performed in field experiments in boreal forests in Sweden with Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Demonstrating the occurrence and importance of chemically mediated interactions among plants is not trivial. If even a small portion of the thousands of chemicals produced by different plant species have effects on their neighbours, then species-specific interactions, natural selection, community integration, and community coevolution may be quite different than predicted by conceptual models based solely on resource competition. Appropriate methodology is crucial for integrating chemically mediated interactions into ecological theory.},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm for the disproportionate number of flowering plants is the unique coevolution that they underwent with pollinating insects. The theory underlying this biotic pollination hypothesis contradicts more generally accepted evolutionary theory. Furthermore, various lines of empirical evidence falsify the biotic pollination hypothesis: (a) several lineages of plants were insect pollinated - angiosperms, Gnetales, Bennettitales, Cheirolepidiaceae, Medullosales, and Cycadales - yet only the first four were ever diverse or underwent radiations; (b) the predicted rise in insect diversity, which was coupled with angiosperm radiation, does not appear in the fossil record; (c) the family Poaceae (grasses) are wind pollinated, yet are exceptionally diverse and species-rich; and (d) the family Formicidae (ants) were not pollinators, yet are exceptionally species-rich and ecologically dominant. I enumerate many alternate (and seldom investigated) hypotheses for these patterns of seed plant diversity, keeping in mind that although I show that insect pollination was neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for large numbers of species, it may have played a substantial role in both plant and insect speciation. Alternatively, existing theory regarding the biotic pollination hypothesis can be refined in an attempt to eliminate the aforementioned empirical anomalies and theoretical inconsistencies.

abstract = {In this paper we argue that two-species models of mutualism may be oversimplifications of the real world that lead to erroneous predictions. We present a four-species model of a pollination mutualism embedded in other types of community interactions. Conclusions derived from two-species models about the destabilizing effect of mutualisms are misleading when applied to the present scenario; although the mutualisms are locally destabilizing, the effect is more than canceled by an increased chance of feasibility. The crucial difference is the interaction of the mutualists with other species in a larger web. Furthermore, community persistence ( without unrealistic population explosion), arguably a superior ecological criterion, is greatly enhanced by the presence of mutualisms. Therefore, we predict that mutualisms should be common in the real world, a prediction matching empirial findings and in contrast to the predictions from local stability analysis of basic two-species models. This method of stabilizing a mutualism appears superior in some ways to the often-used method of introducing density dependence in the strength of the mutualism, because it permits obligate mutualisms to exist even at low densities, again matching empirical findings. Lastly, this study is an example of how complex model assemblages can behave qualitatively differently From analogous simpler ones. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Whereas large body size has been traditionally put forward as a major biological factor "allowing" herbivory and frugivory in lizards, a recent review of frugivory and seed dispersal by lizards showed that frugivory might be considered to be a typical island phenomenon, independent of body size. Here we show that frugivory is correlated with lizard body size among a group of syntopic Anolis species in Jamaica, with larger species eating more fruit. Additionally, the size of the fruits consumed is significantly related to lizard body size. Multiple regression analyses show that this is largely a pure body size effect as head shape or residual bite force are uncorrelated to overall fruit size. Moreover, we demonstrate that among polychrotid (Anolis-like) lizards in general, those that consume fruit are on average larger than those that do not. Lizards from the mainland were not significantly different in body size from island species. We thus suggest that fruit consumption in polychrotid lizards is mediated by large body size whether living on islands or not.},

abstract = {Many of the most commonly cited examples of exquisite adaptation are of coevolved symbioses. As we learn more about the coevolutionary process, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that coevolution may also keep populations moderately maladapted much of the time. As a result, coevolving populations may only rarely occupy adaptive peaks, because the selective landscape is under continual change through reciprocal selection on the species themselves. These shifting patterns of coadaptation are further shaped by the geographic structure of most species. Selection mosaics across landscapes and coevolutionary hotspots can favor different evolutionary trajectories in different populations. The combined action of gene flow, random genetic drift, and local extinction of populations may then continually remold these local patterns, creating a geographic mosaic in the degrees of maladaptation found within local interactions. Recent mathematical models of the geographic mosaic of coevolution suggest that complex mosaics of maladaptation are a likely consequence of spatially structured species interactions. These models indicate that the spatial structure of maladaptation may depend upon the type of coevolutionary interaction, the underlying selection mosaic, and patterns of gene flow across landscapes. By maintaining local polymorphisms and driving the divergence of populations, coevolution may produce spatial patterns of maladaptation that are a source of ongoing innovation and diversification in species interactions.},

Amphiprion stimulates increases in host area, the shared resource, but social interactions cap the number of anemonefish to two adults per host. Space generated by the mutualism becomes differentially available to Dascyllus because the effectiveness of an anemonefish in excluding its competitor declines with increases in the area it defends. This alters Amphiprion's ratio of per capita intra- to interspecific effects and thus facilitates coexistence of the fishes. This mechanism may be prevalent in nature, adding another major pathway by which mutualism can enhance diversity.},

Specifically, we experimentally examine the role of a filamentous bacterium (actinomycete), which is typically carried on the cuticle of fungus-growing ants, in suppressing the growth of a specialized microfungal parasite (Escovopsis) of the fungus garden. We conducted two-by-two factorial design experiments crossing the presence/absence of actinomycete with the presence/absence of Escovopsis within small sub-colonies of Acromyrmex octospinosus. In these experiments, infection by Escovopsis became much more extensive within fungus gardens and had a greater impact on the health of gat-dens in those sub-colonies with the bacterium removed from workers as compared to gardens with the bacterium still present on the ants. We establish that the actinomycete bacterium is most abundant on those major workers tending the garden, providing further support that the bacterium is involved in garden hygiene. We also found a significantly higher abundance of actinomycete on workers in colonies experimentally infected with Escovopsis as compared to uninfected control colonies. We suggest that mutualisms between antibiotic-producing microbes and higher organisms may be common associations that are mostly overlooked and that the role of symbionts in reducing the impact of parasites is likely an important aspect in the cost- benefit assessment of mutualisms.},

abstract = {We collected and analysed nucleotide sequence and protein electrophoretic data in order to estimate phylogenies of figs and fig-pollinating wasps at several taxonomic scales. The relatively conserved chloroplast gene coding rbCl allowed the estimation of the taxonomic position of Ficus relative to other genera within the Moraceae. Further, in conjunction with chloroplast tRNA spacer genes, rbcL sequences allowed the partial resolution of the phylogenetic associations of fig species from different parts of the world with representatives from all the recognized subgenera of Fiats. The phylogeny of the corresponding wasp species that pollinate most of those taxa was estimated using mitochondrial COI-COII and 12S ribosomal genes. At a fine scale, the phylogenies of species within two subgenera of figs growing in Panama (Urostigma, and Pharmacosycea) were estimated by using protein electrophoretic data. The phylogeny of the corresponding pollinator wasp species was estimated using COII sequence data. Although we need to extend the taxa sampled and augment the molecular database, the host and pollinator phylogenies show a high degree of congruence and the results support the predominance of strict-sense coevolution between figs and their pollinator wasps at both global and fine scales. },

Here, we examine whether the diversity of food plants, contemporary climate and energy, or habitat heterogeneity determine species richness patterns of avian frugivores across sub-Saharan Africa. Path models indicate that species richness of Ficus (their fruits being one of the major food resources for frugivores in the tropics) has the strongest direct effect on richness of avian frugivores, whereas the influences of variables related to water-energy and habitat heterogeneity are mainly indirect. The importance of Ficus richness for richness of avian frugivores diminishes with decreasing specialization of birds on fruit eating, but is retained when accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We suggest that a positive relationship between food plant and frugivore species richness could result from niche assembly mechanisms (e.g. coevolutionary adaptations to fruit size, fruit colour or vertical stratification of fruit presentation) or, alternatively, from stochastic speciation-extinction processes. In any case, the close relationship between species richness of Ficus and avian frugivores suggests that figs are keystone resources for animal consumers, even at continental scales.},

Recent surveys and careful censuses revealed that the four taxa exclusively restricted to rocky habitats (Borderea chouardii, Androsace pyrenaica, Petrocoptis pseudoviscosa, Petrocoptis montsicciana) have more populations and/or individuals than previously thought. The remaining species, an orchid (Cypripedium calceolus), showed an important decline in population number. So while the rupicolous taxa might be considered naturally rare, the orchid is becoming rare. We failed to find evidence of current poor performance within populations, as recruitment was detected, population growth rate was quite stable in recent years, fruit and seed set was apparently adequate, and herbivory and predation were absent or very low. Additionally, most of the species show a long life span, which might buffer them against demographic and environmental stochasticity in absence of human disturbance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

During the 3-year study, the gorillas ate 16 species of fruit on 27{\%} of observation days. There was high variability in frugivory among the 3 years and no consistent seasonal pattern. Annual home range size was ca. 21 km(2) for Years 1 and 2, and it increased dramatically to 40 km(2) in Year 3. Home range size varied considerable between months and seasons, but there is no clear relationship between occurrence of fruit-eating and home range size. The group exhibited more fruit-eating and a larger home range size those of the gorillas in the Virunga Volcanoes. Their home range size is comparable to that of western gorillas, though Bwindi gorillas consumed less fruit. Home range size and utilization by all gorillas probably depends on a complex relationship between the distribution and abundance of both fruit and herbaceous vegetation and social factors such as male mating tactics.},

A seed-addition experiment, using 32 species which do not belong to the local species pool, was performed on Monte San Giorgio (southern Switzerland) to test whether the low recruitment success was due to dispersal limitation or due to unfavourable microsite conditions. In October 1997, 20 species were individually sown in six 3 x 4 m blocks of a 2 x 2 factorial 'partial' split-plot design with treatments of abandonment vs, mowing and undisturbed vs. root-removed soil, this last being applied in small naturally-degradable pots. Moreover, 12 species were sown only in the treatments on undisturbed soil. Seedlings of sown and spontaneously germinating seeds were observed on 16 occasions over one 12-month period. Seeds of 31 out of the 32 species germinated. Twenty-four species showed germination rates higher than 5{\%} and different seasonal germination patterns. Established vegetation, especially the tussocks of Molinia arundinacea, reduced the quality of microsites for germination. Whereas a few species germinated better under the litter of Molinia arundinacea, many more germinated better under the more variable microsite conditions of a mown grassland. Only a few seedlings of 25 species out of the 31 germinated species survived until October 1998. Seedling survival was negatively affected by litter, unfavourable weather conditions (frost and dry periods followed by heavy rains) and herbivory (slugs and grasshoppers). Tussocks of Molinia arundinacea, however, tended to protect seedlings. The poor establishment success of 'new' species observed in abandoned meadows on Monte San Giorgio after resumed mowing is due to dispersal and microsite limitations.},

abstract = {This study partitions selection in a natural metapopulation of a riparian plant species, Silene tatarica, into individual- and patch-level components by using contextual analysis, in which a patch refers to a spatially distinct stand of individual plants. We estimated selection gradients for two morphological characters (plant height and number of stems), their respective patch means, and plant density with respect to reproductive success in a two-year study. The approach was also extended to partition selection separately within habitats with varying degrees of exposure to river disturbances and herbivory. The selection differentials and gradients for plant height were positive at both individual and patch levels, with selection forces highest in the closed habitat with low exposure to disturbance. This pattern suggests that local groups with taller than average plants are more visible to pollinators than to groups that are shorter than average plants; and, within patches, individuals with short stature are visited less often than taller ones. Selection on the number of stems was in opposition at individual and patch levels. At the individual level the character was selected toward higher values, whereas selection at the patch-level favored smaller mean number of stems. The strength of the latter component was associated with the intensity of herbivory in different habitats, suggesting that the patch-level selection against a large number of stems might be due to high attractiveness of such patches to the main herbivore, reindeer. Consequently, direction and strength of selection in spatially structured populations may depend significantly on fitness effects arising at the group level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic importance of grapevine has driven significant efforts in genomics to accelerate the exploitation of Vitis resources for development of new cultivars. However, although a large number of clonally propagated accessions are maintained in grape germplasm collections worldwide, their use for crop improvement is limited by the scarcity of information on genetic diversity, population structure and proper phenotypic assessment. The identification of representative and manageable subset of accessions would facilitate access to the diversity available in large collections. A genome-wide germplasm characterization using molecular markers can offer reliable tools for adjusting the quality and representativeness of such core samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We investigated patterns of molecular diversity at 22 common microsatellite loci and 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2273 accessions of domesticated grapevine V. vinifera ssp. sativa, its wild relative V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris, interspecific hybrid cultivars and rootstocks. Despite the large number of putative duplicates and extensive clonal relationships among the accessions, we observed high level of genetic variation. In the total germplasm collection the average genetic diversity, as quantified by the expected heterozygosity, was higher for SSR loci (0.81) than for SNPs (0.34). The analysis of the genetic structure in the grape germplasm collection revealed several levels of stratification. The primary division was between accessions of V. vinifera and non-vinifera, followed by the distinction between wild and domesticated grapevine. Intra-specific subgroups were detected within cultivated grapevine representing different eco-geographic groups. The comparison of a phenological core collection and genetic core collections showed that the latter retained more genetic diversity, while maintaining a similar phenotypic variability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive molecular characterization of our grape germplasm collection contributes to the knowledge about levels and distribution of genetic diversity in the existing resources of Vitis and provides insights into genetic subdivision within the European germplasm. Genotypic and phenotypic information compared in this study may efficiently guide further exploration of this diversity for facilitating its practical use.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of seeds can influence several parameters of the natural regeneration of plant populations. Factors shaping seedfall patterns have been typically explored from the tree perspective (seed shadow) or from the population perspective (seed rain). However, the seed rain is actually composed of multiple seed shadows. In this paper, we use this framework to explore the variables shaping the seedfall pattern of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a fleshy-fruited tree of the Mediterranean scrublands. We monitored the movement patterns of avian seed dispersers and the seedfall around each fruit-bearing O. europaea tree in two contrasting sites, differing in the degree of human management and abundance of scrub cover.None of the seed dispersers moved between microhabitats (different shrub species and open interspaces) as a function of microhabitat relative abundance. All dispersers foraged preferentially at O. europaea; only the smaller species visited open interspaces, and these only sporadically.Avoidance of open sites by frugivores, especially larger species, and their attraction to source trees were the major determinants of the seedfall pattern. Regarding seed size distribution among microhabitats, we found that only small seeds were significantly overrepresented in open interspaces. From the seed shadow perspective, seed density under trees was similar in the: two study sites, but it decreased with distance at a higher rate in the disturbed scrubland. From the seed rain perspective, seed density was significantly different among microhabitats, with open interspaces collecting few, if any, seeds, and places under source trees receiving the highest densities.Results from seed shadow and seed rain analyses were integrated to construct a path model to explore the relative contribution of spatial, microhabitat, and individual tree features to the seedfall pattern. Factors related to microhabitat were identified as having a major role in shaping seedfall pattern. Open interspaces collected few seeds, points under shrub species with sparse foliage collected moderate seed densities, and points under shrubs with dense foliage collected the highest seed densities. The comparison between sites suggests that habitat alteration (a reduction of the scrub layer) can lead to contrasting seedfall patterns. The occurrence of an abundant scrub layer in the well-preserved scrubland allowed a complex pattern of seed rain. In contrast, the sparse scrub cover in the disturbed scrubland yielded a seedfall pattern composed of multiple seed shadows constrained to the vicinity of tree crowns. Thus, our sampling design and analytical approach have proved useful in describing the relative importance of the set of variables that shapes the complex seedfall pattern of a bird-dispersed plant. This seedfall pattern, in turn, is central to the understanding of the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and the efficiency of the dispersal mutualism.},

abstract = {Structural and floristic components of vegetation and fruit production were examined to evaluate the relative importance of each vegetation aspect on patterns of habitat use and to determine whether differences in degree of frugivory would affect sensitivity of birds to vegetation components. Abundances of 12 bird species were quantified in four different habitat types in the Southeastern Atlantic rain forest of Brazil using captures with mist nets. Structural and floristic traits and fruit production were sampled within plots along the mist net lines. Best explanations for the variation in species abundance were obtained by different combinations of the vegetation components (generalized linear models, Akaike information criterion; R-2 mean values = 0.48, Delta AlCc = 0). Although each species had a particular preference for some vegetation variables, floristic components stood out in those relationships, generating models with a stronger explanatory capacity (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.40) and higher levels of empirical support (A AlCc = minimum values). The variation in bird sensitivities to the floristic component was associated with bird dependence on a fruit diet: there was a correlation between the explanatory capacity of models built with only floristic composition and a species' degree of frugivory (Spearman rank correlation, r = 0.66, P = 0.04), indicating that floristics had a higher effect in more frugivorous birds. For the other vegetation components, there was no clear pattern with statistical support. These results indicate that sensitivities of bird species to vegetation aspects are associated with their dependence on a fruit diet.},

abstract = {Bees, the largest ({\textgreater} 16,000 species) and most important radiation of pollinating insects, originated in early to mid-Cretaceous, roughly in synchrony with the angiosperms (flowering plants). Understanding the diversification of the bees and the coevolutionary history of bees and angiosperms requires a well supported phylogeny of bees (as well as angiosperms). We reconstructed a robust phylogeny of bees at the family and subfamily levels using a data set of five genes (4,299 nucleotide sites) plus morphology (109 characters). The molecular data set included protein coding (elongation factor-1 alpha, RNA polymerase II, and LW rhodopsin), as well as ribosomal (28S and 18S) nuclear gene data. Analyses of both the DNA data set and the DNA+morphology data set by parsimony and Bayesian methods yielded a single well supported family-level tree topology that places Melittidae as a paraphyletic group at the base of the phylogeny of bees. This topology ("Melittidae-LT basal") is significantly better than a previously proposed alternative topology ("Colletidae basal") based both on likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our results have important implications for understanding the early diversification, historical biogeography, host-plant evolution, and fossil record of bees. The earliest branches of bee phylogeny include lineages that are predominantly host-plant specialists, suggesting that host-plant specificity is an ancestral trait in bees. Our results suggest an African origin for bees, because the earliest branches of the tree include predominantly African lineages. These results also help explain the predominance of Melittidae, Apidae, and Megachilidae among the earliest fossil bees.},

These processes depend on differential recruitment of plant species as a function of disperser preferences, rather than on adjustments based on evolutionary processes. On the plant side, there is a prevalence of historical and phylogenetic effects, which reflects a series of ecological limitations inherent to the interactions between plants and dispersal agents that constrain plant adaptation to dispersers. To test adaptive hypotheses and explanations, future investigations on Mediterranean plant-disperser systems should concentrate more on the animal than on the plant side of the interaction.},

abstract = {The primary aim of this paper is to discuss the methodological approaches that may best develop studies of allelopathy in the future. Laboratory studies on the functions of isolated chemicals, no matter how mechanistically detailed, cannot demonstrate the significance of allelopathy in communities. Evidence for allelopathy in natural plant communities should include information of concentrations and release rates such as demonstrated in field soils for (+/-)- catechin and Centaurea maculosa Lam. Community-relevant evidence for allelopathy should include some manipulation of exudates such as performed in many experiments with activated carbon and gel filtration columns. Realistic evidence for allelopathy should include separation of resource effects from chemical effects; such as demonstrated by experiments with activated carbon additions, density-dependent responses to additions of competitors and chemicals, and resource addition treatments. Community-relevant evidence should link laboratory effects to field patterns and experiments; such as the links between the inhibitory effects of roots of Larrea tridentata Cov., the highly spatially segregated root systems and regular above-ground spacing of this species, strong spatial disassociation of L. tridentata with other species, and removal experiments indicating that segregation of L. tridentata root systems via allelopathy may feed back to sequestering of resource use. Studies of allelopathy should consider chemically initiated shifts in microbial populations, and the effects of organic and inorganic soil components on the function of exudates; which has been done in a number of studies. Finally, studies of allelopathy should include large-scale manipulation of chemical effects; such as performed in field experiments in boreal forests in Sweden with Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Demonstrating the occurrence and importance of chemically mediated interactions among plants is not trivial. If even a small portion of the thousands of chemicals produced by different plant species have effects on their neighbours, then species-specific interactions, natural selection, community integration, and community coevolution may be quite different than predicted by conceptual models based solely on resource competition. Appropriate methodology is crucial for integrating chemically mediated interactions into ecological theory.},

abstract = {Worldwide declines in bird numbers have recently renewed interest in how well bird--plant mutualisms are functioning. In New Zealand, it has been argued that bird pollination was relatively unimportant and bird- pollination failure was unlikely to threaten any New Zealand plants, whereas dispersal mutualisms were widespread and in some cases potentially at risk because of reliance on a single large frugivore, the kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae). Work since 1989, however, has changed that assessment. Smaller individual fruits of most plant species can be dispersed by mid-sized birds such as tui (Prosthemadera novaezelandiae) because both fruits and birds vary in size within a species. Only one species (Beilschmiedia tarairi) has no individual fruits small enough for this to occur. Germination of 19 fleshy-fruited species, including most species with fruits {\textgreater}8 mm diameter, does not depend on birds removing the fruit pulp. The few studies of fruit removal rates mostly (7 out of 10) show good dispersal quantity. So dispersal is less at risk than once thought. In contrast, there is now evidence for widespread pollen limitation in species with ornithophilous flowers. Tests on 10 of the 29 known native ornithophilous-flowered species found that in 8 cases seed production was reduced by at least one-third, and the pollen limitation indices overall were significantly higher than the global average. Birds also frequently visit flowers of many other smaller-flowered native species, and excluding birds significantly reduced seed set in the three species tested. So pollination is more at risk than once thought. Finally, analyses of both species numbers and total woody basal area show that dependence on bird pollination is unexpectedly high. Birds have been recorded visiting the flowers of 85 native species, representing 5{\%} of the total seed-plant flora (compared with 12{\%} of those with fleshy fruit) and 30{\%} of the tree flora (compared with 59{\%} with fleshy fruit). A higher percentage of New Zealand forest basal area has bird-visited flowers (37{\%} of basal area nationally) than fleshy fruit (31{\%}). Thus, bird pollination is more important in New Zealand than was realised, partly because birds visit many flowers that do not have classic ``ornithophilous'' flower morphology.},

Here the genus Prodoxus, the non-pollinating sister group of the pollinators, is revised using morphological and molecular data, their phylogenetic relationships are analysed, and the evolution of host tissue specialization explored. Twenty-two species are recognized, including nine new species: Prodoxus gypsicolor sp.n., P. sonorensis sp.n., P. carnerosanellus sp.n., P. tamaulipellus sp.n., P. weethumpi sp.n., P. tehuacanensis sp.n., P. californicus sp.n., P. mapimiensis sp.n. and P. atascosanellus sp.n. Prodoxus y-inversus Riley, P. coloradensis Riley and P. sordidus Riley are redescribed. The genus Agavenema is synonymized with Prodoxus. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that stalk-feeding is basal within the group, that there are three separate origins of fruit-feeding, and one origin of leaf-mining from a stalk-feeding ancestor. Although species with different feeding habits often coexist within hosts, the analyses suggest that ecological specialization and diversification within a host only may have occurred within one or possibly two hosts.},

abstract = {The relationship between an endemic lizard (Gallotia galloti) and plants with fleshy fruits was examined in a xeric habitat on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. An analysis of 441 droppings collected in May 1991, showed that fruits are an important item in the diet of this omnivorous lizard; 92{\%} and 56{\%} of droppings contained fruits from two different areas. Fruits of seven plant species were found in the droppings: Rubia fruticosa, Neochamaelea pulverulenta, Withania aristata, Lycium intricatum, Atriplex semibaccata, Opuntia dillenii and Scilla cf. haemorrhoidalis. The number of fruit species consumed at each area by G. galloti was related to their availability. Seed Viability did not differ between control seeds and seeds from the droppings, except for N. pulverulenta and L. intricatum, where viability was higher in control seeds. The gut passage of seeds significantly reduced the germination of R. fruticosa and N. pulverulenta, increased that of W aristata while no differences were found for the rest. Gallotia galloti preferred rocky and grassy sites with,less open ground and more shrub cover {\textgreater}50 cm in height). This should produce a non-random seed shadow in the habitats, potentially affecting the distribution of species with fleshy fruits. Omnivorous lizards on islands can act as important seed dispersers over short distances for plant species with fleshy fruits, actively influencing both their relative abundance and vegetation structure in xeric habitats.},

abstract = {Prey (N) dependence [g(N)], predator (P) dependence [g(P) or g(N,P)], and ratio dependence [f(P/N)] are often seen as contrasting forms of the predator's functional response describing predator consumption rates on prey resources in predator-prey and parasitoid-host interactions. Analogously, prey-, predator-, and ratio-dependent functional responses are apparently alternative functional responses for other types of consumer-resource interactions. These include, for example, the fraction of flowers pollinated or seeds parasitized in pollination (pre-dispersal) seed-parasitism mutualisms, such as those between fig wasps and fig trees or yucca moths and yucca plants. Here we examine the appropriate functional responses for how the fraction of flowers pollinated and seeds parasitized vary with the density of pollinators (predator dependence) or the ratio of pollinator and flower densities (ratio dependence). We show that both types of functional responses can emerge from minor, but biologically important variations on a single model. An individual-based model was first used to describe plant-pollinator interactions. Conditional upon on whether the number of flowers visited by the pollinator was limited by factors other than search time (e.g., by the number of eggs it had to lay, if it was also a seed parasite), and on whether the pollinator could directly find flowers on a plant, or had to search, the simulation results lead to either a predator-dependent or a ratio-dependent functional response. An analytic model was then used to show mathematically how these two cases can arise. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phenological transects were employed to assess monthly leaf, flower, unripe fruit and ripe fruit abundance for a total of 1732 individual plants within five tropical forest habitats at the 'Lago Caiman Research Camp', Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, northeastern Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia. Fruit surveys along trails were conducted concomitantly to assess fruit availability for the resident terrestrial frugivore community. The results of the two methodologies are compared and discussed with respect to wildlife and forest management in the region. Phenological transects revealed that Cerrado forest. tall forest, low vine forest. Sartenejal (swamp) forest, and pied mont (premontane) forest, showed seasonal variations in flower, unripe fruit and ripe fruit abundance. however, the broad temporal patterns were significantly different across habitats. Seasonal variation in overall foliage abundance was only marked for Cerrado forest. Ripe fruit production within the study site was not significantly different across months, with different habitats peaking asynchronously in abundance. From a frugivory perspective, overall ripe fleshy fruit abundance also varied considerably between habitats, and again showed asynchronous peaks in habitat production. However, both methodologies revealed the early dry season (June-July) as a period of ripe fleshy fruit scarcity throughout the study area. This period represents a resource 'bottleneck' for the resident frugivore community and phenological results allowed the identification of a number of keystone fruit resources for the region. Furthermore, fruit resources which are super-abundant in the early-mid wet season (November-February) might also be considered keystone resources for the region, given that they axe available in an otherwise fruit scarce forest. The dynamic spatial patterning of fruit availability at Lago Caiman suggests that certain habitats might be considered keystone habitats, since they provide the majority of fruit resources on a seasonal basis. Finally, the potential of phenological information in tropical forest management plans is discussed and underlined by the observation that rainfall in itself fails to predict fruit availability in the dominant habitats at Lago Caiman.

abstract = {Pollinator-mediated selection is one of the most important factors driving adaptation in flowering plants. However, as ecological conditions change through habitat loss and fragmentation, the interactions among species may evolve in new and unexpected directions. Human-induced environmental variation is likely to affect selection regimes, but as yet no empirical examples have been reported. In the study reported here, we examined the influence of human-induced habitat transformation on the composition of pollinator assemblages and, hence, pollinator-mediated selection on the flower phenotype of Viola portalesia (Violaceae). Our results indicate that pollinator assemblages differed substantially in terms of species composition and visitation rate between nearby native and transformed habitats. Similarly, the insect species that contributed most to visitation rates differed between plant populations. While the magnitude and sign of pollinator-mediated selection on flower length and width did not differ between sites, selection for flower number lost significance in the transformed habitat, and a significant pattern of disruptive selection for flower shape, undetected in the native habitat, was present in the transformed one. Overall, the results of this study suggest that human-induced habitat change may not only modify the species composition of pollinator assemblages, relaxing the selection process on some flower characters, but they may also create new opportunities for fitness-trait covariation not present in pristine conditions.},

abstract = {Cooperation invites cheating, and nowhere is this more apparent than when different species cooperate, known as mutualism. In almost all mutualisms studied, specialist parasites have been identified that purloin the benefits that one mutualist provides another. Explaining how parasites are kept from driving mutualisms extinct remains an unsolved problem because existing theories explaining the maintenance of cooperation do not apply to parasites of mutualisms. Nonetheless, these theories can be summarized in such a way as to suggest how mutualisms can persist in the face of parasites. (1) For cooperation to occur, the recipient of a benefit must reciprocate, and the recriprocated benefit must be captured by the initial giver or its offspring. (2) For cooperation to persist, the mutualism must be re-assembled each generation. Because most mutualisms are of the 'by-product' type, broadly defined, the first condition is normally always fulfilled. Thus, the maintenance of mutualism usually requires enforcement of the second condition: reliable re-assembly. Hence, I argue that the persistence of mutualism is best understood by using theories of species coexistence, because each mutualist can be considered a resource for the other, and species coexistence theory explains how multiple taxa (e.g. parasites and mutualists) can stably partition a resource over multiple generations. This approach connects the study of mutualism to theories of population regulation and helps to identify key factors that have promoted the evolution, maintenance and breakdown of mutualism. I discuss how these ideas might apply to and be tested in ant-plant, fig-wasp and yucca-moth mutualisms. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.},

Preliminary results show that recruitment of seedlings and juveniles of 31 animal-dispersed tree species was more than three times greater in continuous forest and large forest fragments (greater than or equal to 30 ha) than in small forest fragments (less than or equal to 59 ha), whereas recruitment of eight wind- and gravity-dispersed trees of the forest interior was unaffected. Recruitment of 10 endemic, animal-dispersed tree species was 40 times lower in small fragments than in continuous forest or large fragments. Counts of diurnal primates and birds in all five sites indicated that frugivorous species have declined with decreasing fragment size.

abstract = {This study examines the effects of two predatory ants, Myrmica rubra L. and Formica aquilonia Yarr. on the herbivory and growth of two phytochemically different willow species: low- salicylate Salix phylicifolia L. and high-salicylate Salix myrsinifolia Salisb. The net influence of ants on willow growth will depend on a balance between the benefits ants provide to the plant through predation on herbivores and the costs to the plant through the protection of aphids. Using both field observations and experimental manipulations of the densities of ants and tended aphids, I tested the hypothesis that this balance differs between the two willow species. On both observational and experimental willows, I followed the insect densities throughout one growing season and measured leaf damage and willow growth. The results from both data sets suggest that the effects of ants on the herbivory and consequent growth of these willows differ. Especially F. aquilonia had a positive effect on the growth of S. phylicifolia, whereas the effect on S. myrsinifolia was negligible or even slightly negative. These differences can be derived from three factors: (1) the ant-tended aphid Pterocomma salicis L. was very abundant on both willow species; leading to strong negative impact of ants on the willows, (2) S. myrsinifolia harbored lower densities of leaf-chewing insects, which made the positive effect of ants through reduced leaf damage less likely, and (3) the dominant leaf-chewing herbivore on S. myrsinifolia, a leaf beetle Phratora vitellinae L., is chemically defended against predatory ants, being thus less preyed on than the predominating generalist leaf-chewing herbivores on S. phylicifolia. Furthermore, when ants were not- attending aphids, they even facilitated P. vitellinae, apparently by removing other predators. This study provides one explanation for the debate of whether ants benefit or harm plants: differences in herbivore resistance of plants may lead to diverging or even opposite results in tritrophic interactions between plants, their herbivores, and predatory ants.; },

The theory underlying this biotic pollination hypothesis contradicts more generally accepted evolutionary theory. Furthermore, various lines of empirical evidence falsify the biotic pollination hypothesis: (a) several lineages of plants were insect pollinated - angiosperms, Gnetales, Bennettitales, Cheirolepidiaceae, Medullosales, and Cycadales - yet only the first four were ever diverse or underwent radiations; (b) the predicted rise in insect diversity, which was coupled with angiosperm radiation, does not appear in the fossil record; (c) the family Poaceae (grasses) are wind pollinated, yet are exceptionally diverse and species-rich; and (d) the family Formicidae (ants) were not pollinators, yet are exceptionally species-rich and ecologically dominant. I enumerate many alternate (and seldom investigated) hypotheses for these patterns of seed plant diversity, keeping in mind that although I show that insect pollination was neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for large numbers of species, it may have played a substantial role in both plant and insect speciation. Alternatively, existing theory regarding the biotic pollination hypothesis can be refined in an attempt to eliminate the aforementioned empirical anomalies and theoretical inconsistencies.

From July 2001 to July 2003, 48 plants were grown in an old-field site following a three-factor randomized blocked design where treatments were: ant (ants present and absent), nutrient (without and with nutrient addition), and light (sun and shade). During the experiment, in the absence of ants, plants growing in sunlight were shorter, developed fewer leaves and leaflets, were more damaged by herbivores, had half the total dry biomass, and died more frequently than plants visited by ants. In contrast, ants had no effect on the growth, survival, and total biomass of shaded plants. Therefore small-scale heterogeneity in the light environment turned mutualism (+,+) into commensalism (+,0).

abstract = {The ant-tended Australian butterfly, Jalmenus evagoras, has been a model system for studying the ecology and evolution of mutualism. A phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I sequences from 242 butterflies (615 bp) and 66 attendant ants (585 bp) from 22 populations was carried out to explore the relationship between ant association and butterfly population structure. This analysis revealed 12 closely related butterfly haplotypes in three distinct clades roughly corresponding to three allopatric subpopulations of the butterflies. Minimal genetic diversity and widespread haplotypes within biogeographical regions Suggest high levels of matrilineal gene flow. Attendant ants are significantly more diverse than was previously thought, with at least seven well-defined clades corresponding to independent morphological determinations, distributed throughout the range of the butterflies. Nested analysis of molecular variance showed that biogeography, host plant, and ant associate all contribute significantly in explaining variation in butterfly genetic diversity, but these variables are not independent of one another. Major influences appear to come from fragmentation due to large-scale biogeographical barriers, and diversification following a shift in habitat preference. A consequence of such a shift could be codiversification of the butterfly with habitatadapted ants, resulting in apparent phylogenetic concordance between butterflies and ants The implications of these results are discussed in terms of possible effects of ant attendance on the diversification of Lycaenidae as a whole.},

abstract = {Literature data were collected on the floristic distribution and toxicity of phytochemicals to herbivores and on herbivore specialization in order to test phytochemical coevolution theory. The theory makes four predictions that can be tested with this information. Herbivores can adapt to novel, more toxic chemicals by becoming specialists, or they can become generalists but at the cost of lower feeding success on any particular host. Thus, the first two predictions are as follows: herbivores should do better on chemicals that are present in their normal host, and this pattern should be stronger for specialists than for generalists. The 'escape and radiation' aspect of the theory holds that if a plant taxon with a novel defense chemical diversifies, the chemical will become widespread. Eventually, herbivores will adapt to and disarm it. So the third prediction is that more widespread chemicals are less toxic than more narrowly distributed ones. Because generalists should not do as well as specialists on chemicals disarmed by the latter, the fourth prediction is that the third prediction should be more true for generalists than specialists and should depend on presence/absence of the chemical in the normal host. Multiple regressions of toxicity (herbivore mortality and final weight) on three predictor variables (chemical presence/absence in the normal host, specialism, and chemical floristic distribution) and relevant interactions were used to test these predictions. Chemical presence/absence in the normal host, the interaction between this variable and specialism, and chemical floristic distribution had significant effects on both measures of toxicity, supporting the first three predictions of the model. Support for the fourth prediction (a three-way interaction among all predictor variables) was evident for final weight but not mortality, perhaps because growth is more responsive to toxicity differences than survival. In short, the phytochemistry literature provides broad support for the phytochemical coevolution model.},

More than 98{\%} of the damage to terminal shoots was caused by goats and Spanish ibex in Sierra Nevada and sheep in Sierra de Baza. Some 72{\%} of the tagged saplings (n = 619) were browsed during at least 1 year of monitoring (1995-1997). There were between-forest differences in herbivory pressure. Moreover, the herbivory pressure was significantly higher during a dry year (1995) than during wet ones (1996 and 1997). Overall, when browsing a sapling, ungulates consumed almost 30{\%} of its apical shoots, and 85{\%} of saplings were browsed more than once after establishment. As a consequence, ungulates severely affected the Scots pine sapling growth rate, and therefore browsed saplings grew slower than saplings unbrowsed by ungulates. Thus, according to exponential growth equations, the time necessary to attain a height threshold to escape from mammalian herbivores (150 cm height in our study forests) and start reproduction was retarded by the herbivory up to 12 years. Ungulates are a major factor hindering the natural regeneration and conservation of the last relict forests of Scots pines in SE Spain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Humans hunt forest vertebrates throughout the tropics. Many preferred game species consume flowers, fruit, seeds and/or leaves, and these interactions will cause their harvest to ramify through forests. Three related issues will determine how severely the harvest of forest vertebrates influences the plant community. First, the types of species selected by hunters and the intensity of the harvest will determine which vertebrates are removed and which remain. Second, the possible presence of ecologically similar, non-game species able to expand their activities to fulfill the ecological role of heavily exploited species will determine how severely the harvest disrupts ecological relationships between the community of forest vertebrates and the community of forest plants. Finally, hunters will alter plant species composition if the harvest of vertebrates differentially affects mutualists or pests of particular plant species. Hunters will also alter plant diversity if the harvest of vertebrates disrupts ecological mechanisms that permit plant species to coexist. I examine hunter selectivity, the intensity of the hunt, possible compensation by non-game species, and the types and strengths of interactions among game species and plants for tropical forests to determine when and where these outcomes occur.},

abstract = {Many insects are attacked by internal parasitoids against which they mount a largely cellular immunological defense. The resistance of a host and the virulence of a parasitoid determine which species survives after parasitism. Drosophila is parasitized by several hymenopterous parasitoids, especially those in the genera Asobara and Leptopilina. Geographic patterns have been found in parasitoid virulence and host resistance, the dearest of which is a dine in Asobara tabida virulence from the north (low) to the south thigh) of Europe. Drosophila melanogaster resistance is highest in central-southern Europe and lower elsewhere. We review and interpret these patterns in the light of recent experimental and theoretical studies of the evolution and coevolution of these traits. We find no evidence for genotype-specific virulence and defense, which makes 'Red Queen'-type coevolution unlikely. The most important explanation for the patterns is geographic differences in host-parasitoid community structure. Asobara tabida virulence is positively correlated with the resistance of its main hosts, and there is more limited evidence that D. melanogaster resistance is influenced by the virulence of its parasitoids. We critically appraise whether the evidence available so far supports a coevolutionary explanation for the levels of these trails.},

abstract = {Studies combining comparative genomics and information on biochemical pathways have revealed that protein evolution can be affected by the amount of pleiotropy associated with a particular gene. The amount of pleiotropy, in turn, can be a function of the position at which a gene operates in a pathway and the pathway structure. Genes that serve as convergence points and have several partners (so-called hubs) often show the greatest constraint and hence the slowest rate of protein evolution. In this article, we have studied five genes (Pto, Fen, Rin4, Prf and Pfi) in a defence signalling network in a wild tomato species, Solanum peruvianum. These proteins operate together and contribute to bacterial resistance in tomato. We predicted that Prf (and possibly Pfi), which serves as a convergence point for upstream signals, should show greater evolutionary constraint. However, we found instead that two of the genes which potentially interact with pathogen ligands, Rin4 and Fen, have evolved under strong evolutionary constraint, whereas Prf and Pfi, which probably function further downstream in the network, show evidence of balancing selection. This counterintuitive observation may be probable in pathogen defence networks, because pathogens may target positions throughout resistance networks to manipulate or nullify host resistance, thereby leaving a molecular signature of host-parasite co-evolution throughout a single network.},

This study evaluates whether reciprocal relationships may occur between assemblages of bird and plant species.Location Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (48degrees 50' - N, 125degrees 22' -W).Methods The distribution and fruiting phenologies of seven shrub species were compared to seasonal changes in habitat selection and seed dispersal by six fruit-eating bird species.Results Shrub species inhabiting forest understorey habitat had earlier fruiting phenologies than shrub species inhabiting forest edge habitat along lake and bog margins. Birds showed a parallel pattern in habitat selection, being more abundant in the forest understorey early in the fruiting season, and more abundant in the forest edge later in the season. Rates of seed deposition covaried with avian habitat selection, in such a way that birds directed seed dispersal into habitats preferred by shrubs.Conclusions These results depict a broad-scale pattern in the abundance of birds and fruits indicative of reciprocal interactions. Seasonal changes in seed dispersal to each habitat appear to reinforce the relationship between shrub habitat affinities and fruiting phenologies. Phenological differences between habitats may also reinforce seasonal changes in avian habitat selection. Therefore, although reciprocal interactions between pairs of bird and plant species are rare, broad-scale reciprocal relationships may occur between assemblages of bird and plant species.},

During November 1989-December 1996, howlers used 36 of the 63 tree species present on the island as food. Selection ratios indicated that six Ficus species (particularly F. pertusa) were among the seven most important food species. Data on time spent feeding showed that the six Ficus species were among the eight most important food species for the monkeys. Howlers spent 64.2{\%} of their feeding time on Ficus products with F. pertusa being consumed significantly more often than foods from other Ficus species. However, monkeys fed on only one third of the 81 adult Ficus trees on the island. No significant differences were found in various food constituents (water, ash, fibre, protein, carbohydrates, lipids) of the six Ficus and two other abundant species in the habitat, whether across species, plant parts (young leaves, mature leaves, fruits), or between seasons (wet, dry). Monkeys consumed Ficus fruits rather the leaves. Fruits showed a much higher energy,content per g dry weight than leaves. We also estimated the average daily biomass of leaves and fruits of Ficus spp. consumed by howlers and their energetic contribution to the daily diet of these monkeys. We suggest that some of these tendencies to frugivory reflect the abundance of Ficus trees within the home ranges of the howlers; when few fig trees are present, folivory is the dominant tendency, whereas when many fig trees are present, frugivory is dominant.},

abstract = {We studied avian frugivory and seed dispersal in a dioecious shrub, Rhamnus alaternus, focusing on the quantitative and qualitative components of effectiveness. The study took place at three locations in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, and examined bird behaviour, intensity of feeding, and the consequences for seedling emergence. The coincidence between the bird breeding season and fruit ripening of R. alaternus in the absence of other ripe fruit, generates a monospecific interaction. The extant frugivorous species were mainly legitimate seed dispersers and their abundance was low. Sylvia melanocephala and S. undata were the most important at one site whereas S. atricapilla, Erithacus rubecula and Turdus merula predominated at the other two sites. Fruit handling took place directly on the branches. Bird species used microhabitats differently as first post-feeding perch, which usually was a short distance away. The low density of frugivorous birds in all localities, among others factors, resulted in satiation of the disperser community and many mature fruits unconsumed. Both adults and juveniles feed upon the plants and their foraging patterns are similar. Adults of S. melanocephala were observed to feed fruit to nestlings and consequently a second phase of dispersal potentially arises from the transport of fecal sacs. Pulp removal and passage through the digestive tract increased the probability of seedling emergence. This plant-dispersal interaction has important consequences, both positive and negative for the plant. Positively, the fruiting of R. alaternus at a time when other ripe fruits are not available avoids interspecific competition for seed dispersers. In addition, a low density of seed rain may reduce intraspecific competition. Negatively, the low density and small size of the breeding frugivorous bird community limit fruit handling and removal away from the parent plants, while the territorial behaviour of birds at that time of the year reduces the potential distances of seed dispersal.},

Monthly, we determined folivore damage, insect abundance on leaves, and microenvironmental variables (air and soil temperatures, relative humidity, and soil water content). Folivory per month varied between 2.04 +/- 0.45 percent in April and 4.41 +/- 0.86 percent in September. The highest levels of folivory occurred during the end of the wet-warm season (Palicourea), the relatively dry-cool season (Miconia and Ocotea), or during both seasons (Moussonia). Eighty-eight percent of the herbivores were caterpillars (Lepidoptera). Insect abundance was lower in the dry-warm and the beginning of wet-warm seasons (April-July) and higher during the wet-warm and dry cool seasons. Leaf production was continuous throughout the year for Miconia, Moussonia, and Palicourea; Ocotea had a leafing peak during December-March (dry-cool). Folivory and insect abundance were negatively correlated with maximum temperature and positively correlated with soil water content. The correlations between folivory and leaf production were not significant for any of the studied species. Because leaves are produced throughout the year (except for Ocotea), insect abundance was not related to leaf flush. Also, folivory and insect abundance were not correlated (except for Palicourea). Thus, foliar phenology may not be an escape from herbivory, at least for the studied shrub species. Rather, environmental conditions may play an important role in insect abundance and indirectly affect foliar herbivory levels.},

Hence seasonal factors that affect the dynamics of competition can also affect net benefits, especially if the benefit or cost of mutualism also varies seasonally. In the Sonoran Desert, two common species of generalist ants compete for access to extrafloral nectaries on the fishhook barrel cactus Ferocactus wislizeni, but their relative abundances vary seasonally; one ant dominates more cacti in winter/spring, and the other in summer/autumn. Recently, a third ant species, which also varies in abundance seasonally, has appeared at our study sites and is competing With resident ants for access to cactus nectaries. This empirical system motivated us to examine a metapopulation model of competition for patches in an open system with periodic forcing. We use the model to: (1) illustrate three ways in which competing species may differ in their sensitivities to environmental conditions that are consistent with seasonally displaced patterns of abundance; (2) ask under what conditions the invasion of a third competitor into a two-species system could alter the sensitivity of the system to environmental forcing at low vs. high frequency; and (3) show how differences among competitors in the pattern of seasonal forcing alone can dramatically alter the outcome of a competitor invasion. We discuss implications of these results for the ways in which seasonal variation among competing mutualists, and the benefits and costs of mutualism, may affect the functioning of generalized, facultative mutualisms.},

abstract = {Specialization in species interactions is of central importance for understanding the ecological structure and evolution of plant-animal mutualisms. Most plant-animal mutualisms are facultative and strongly asymmetric. In particular, myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) has been regarded as a very generalized interaction. Although some recent studies have suggested that only a few ant species are really important for dispersal, no rigorous measurement of the specialization in ant-seed dispersal mutualisms has been performed. Here, we use individual plants as basic units for replication to investigate the generalization-specialization of the herb Helleborus foetidus on its ant dispersers over a considerable part of its geographical range. We de. ne generalization in terms of diversity components (species richness and evenness) of the ant visitor that realizes dispersal by removing diaspores. We obtain truly comparable values of ant visitor diversity, distinguishing among different functional groups of visitors and identifying incidental visitors and real ant dispersers. Using null model approaches, we test the null hypothesis that ant-mediated dispersal is a generalized mutualism. At least two premises should be confirmed to validate the hypothesis: (1) diaspores are dispersed by multiple ant-visitor species, and (2) diaspore dispersal is significantly equitable. Though up to 37 ant species visited diaspores across 10 populations, only two large formicines, Camponotus cruentatus and Formica lugubris, were responsible for the vast majority of visits resulting in dispersal in most populations and years, which strongly suggests that ant seed dispersal in H. foetidus is ecologically specialized. Interestingly, specialization degree was unrelated to dispersal success across populations. Our study offers new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of myrmecochory. We propose the existence of an alternative scenario to extensive generalization. In this new scenario, generalization is replaced by ecological specialization, which is determined by the intrinsic traits of the plant species rather than by the ecological context in which the interaction takes place.},

Here we contrast the level of seed predation and selection exerted by Common Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex) and red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in the extensive mountain pine (Paws uncinata) forests in the Pyrenees with their level of seed predation in two small, isolated forests. Crossbills consumed 5.1 times more seeds in the Pyrenees than in the isolated forests, and six of seven cone traits under selection by crossbills were enhanced in the Pyrenees. In contrast, red squirrels tend to be uncommon in the open mountain pine forests, consuming relatively few seeds in both regions and having limited impact on both mountain pine and the interaction between crossbills and mountain pine. Resident crossbills in mountain pine forests in the Pyrenees have larger bills than in nearby forests, consistent with local adaptation by crossbills and a coevolutionary arms race between crossbills and mountain pine. The mechanisms leading to variation in the interaction between crossbills and mountain pine should be general to many systems because habitat patch size and structure often vary across the range of a species.},

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Generally, effects of herbivory on plant fitness have been measured in terms of female reproductive success (seed production). However, male plant fitness, defined as the number of seeds sired by pollen, contributes half of the genes to the next generation and is therefore crucial to the evolution of natural plant populations. This is the first study to examine effects of insect herbivory on both male and female plant reproductive success. Through controlled field and greenhouse experiments and genetic paternity analysis, we found that foliar damage by insects caused a range of responses by plants. In one environment, damaged plants had greater success as male parents than undamaged plants. Neither effects on pollen competitive ability nor pollinator visitation patterns could explain the greater siring success of these damaged plants. Success of damaged plants as male parents appeared to be due primarily to changes in allocation to flowers versus seeds after damage. Damaged plants produced more flowers early in the season, but not more seeds, than undamaged plants. Based on total seed production, male fitness measures from the first third of the season, and flower production, we estimated that damaged and undamaged plants had equal total reproductive success at the end of the season in this environment. In a second, richer environment, damaged and undamaged plants had equal male and female plant fitness, and no traits differed significantly between the treatments. Equal total reproductive success may not be ecologically or evolutionarily equivalent if it is achieved differentially through male versus female fitness. Genes from damaged plants dispersed through pollen may escape attack from herbivores, if such attack is correlated spatially from year to year.},

abstract = {Structural and floristic components of vegetation and fruit production were examined to evaluate the relative importance of each vegetation aspect on patterns of habitat use and to determine whether differences in degree of frugivory would affect sensitivity of birds to vegetation components. Abundances of 12 bird species were quantified in four different habitat types in the Southeastern Atlantic rain forest of Brazil using captures with mist nets. Structural and floristic traits and fruit production were sampled within plots along the mist net lines. Best explanations for the variation in species abundance were obtained by different combinations of the vegetation components (generalized linear models, Akaike information criterion; R-2 mean values = 0.48, Delta AlCc = 0). Although each species had a particular preference for some vegetation variables, floristic components stood out in those relationships, generating models with a stronger explanatory capacity (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.40) and higher levels of empirical support (A AlCc = minimum values). The variation in bird sensitivities to the floristic component was associated with bird dependence on a fruit diet: there was a correlation between the explanatory capacity of models built with only floristic composition and a species' degree of frugivory (Spearman rank correlation, r = 0.66, P = 0.04), indicating that floristics had a higher effect in more frugivorous birds. For the other vegetation components, there was no clear pattern with statistical support. These results indicate that sensitivities of bird species to vegetation aspects are associated with their dependence on a fruit diet.},

We examined how variation in resource abundance (forest area of lodgepole pine Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) influenced patterns of co-adaptation and coevolution between red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex) and lodgepole pine populations. First, we found that crossbill abundance increased logarithmically as forest area increased in mountain ranges lacking a preemptive competitor (pine squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Second, seed defences against predation by crossbills increased with increases in crossbill density, suggesting that seed defences have likely evolved in proportion to the intensity of selection that crossbills exert. Third, the average bill size of crossbill populations increased with increasing seed defences, which implies that crossbill offenses increased with increases in seed defences. The large bill size on the largest range is the result of coevolution with lodgepole pine with this crossbill population perhaps speciating. Local adaptation of crossbill populations on smaller ranges, however, is more likely the result of resident crossbills representing a subset of the potential colonists (phenotypic sorting) than of local evolution. In the smallest range, migration and possibly more frequent extinction likely impede local adaptation and may result in maladaptation.},

abstract = {Herbivores may enhance plant recruitment, but such positive interactions may be overlooked in favour of obvious negative effects of herbivory on propagules. My objective was to determine whether larval insects that feed and develop within fruit of the mangrove Avicennia marina act as mutualist herbivores by increasing the dispersal of propagules without affecting their viability and emerging successfully as adults following dispersal of the propagule by water. Surveys revealed that frugivory is common throughout the mangrove forest, and fruit had up to six exit holes where larvae had emerged as adults. Larval insects did not affect the flotation of propagules with pericarps, a thin structure that provides buoyancy for dispersal by water. In contrast, after simulating germination by removing the pericarp, the majority of propagules with three exit holes floated on average for 20 h longer than those without exit holes, which sank immediately. Based on this evidence that frugivory could increase the dispersal potential of propagules, I predicted that propagules consumed by larval insects should disperse farther than undamaged propagules, and this was tested by quantifying the potential viability of propagules stranded on beaches at increasing distances (up to 20 km) from mangrove forests. Flies and moths emerged as adults after being transported tens of kilometres within mangrove propagules, revealing a novel mode of dispersal. Proportionally fewer potentially viable propagules were supplied to beaches at increasing distances from mangrove forests, however, indicating that larval insects negatively affect recruitment and are thus not acting as mutualist herbivores. Nevertheless, when transported back to the mangrove forest, seedlings established from propagules damaged by larval insects and stranded on beaches. Therefore, although frugivory does not preclude mangrove recruitment, its negative effects in the pre-dispersal environment may be intensified with increasing dispersal distance, thus limiting the long-distance supply of propagules and recruitment of mangroves.},

In fall samples from seed traps and fecal droppings, introduced species accounted for 0.4-14{\%} of fruit biomass overall and 3 - 30{\%} of the biomass of low-quality fruits. Although absolute fruit use declined from fall to winter, relative use of introduced species increased seasonally to as high as half of winter fruit biomass. Heavy use of non-native fruits appears recent; introductions accounted for only 2{\%} of plant species occurrences in fall and winter records of stomach contents for nine passerine species in New England and mid-Atlantic states between 1881 and 1950. Introduced fruits with fall maturation, low-quality pulp, and high durability now rival native species in fruit diets of birds in late fall arid winter. The success of introductions demonstrates coadaptation through ecological fitting of preadapted partners; nevertheless, the predominant use of introduced fruits after peak bird migration suggests that introduced fruits may be less well matched to local dispersal opportunities than native ones.},

In the monoecious fig/pollinator wasp mutualism, each female flower produces either a seed or a pollinator offspring (which has fed on a single seed).

Thus the fig tree is selected to produce both seed and pollinator offspring whereas for the pollinator there is no short term advantage in seed production. Using controlled pollination experiments (pollen injection, and foundress introduction), we show that 1) The relative proportion of seeds and pollinator offspring produced (i.e., the effective allocation between female and male function) depends mainly on the number of foundresses that entered the syconium. 2) Many female flowers within every syconium mature neither a seed nor a wasp (from 25{\%} to 33{\%}). 3) All the female flowers within a syconium that are not vacant at maturity have the potential to produce a seed, and at least 80{\%} of them can produce a pollinator.

Within ecological communities, the timing of interactions among species may be altered if the species experience asymmetrical phenological shifts. We present a model that examines the consequences of changes in the relative timing of herbivory and pollination in a community of herbivores and pollinators that share a host plant. Our model suggests that phenological shifts can alter the abundances of these species and, in some cases, their population dynamics. If historical patterns of interactions in a community change and herbivores become active before pollinators, the community could see a reduction in pollinators and an increase in herbivores, while if pollinators become active before herbivores, there could be a loss of stable coexistence. Previous studies have warned of the potential for climate change to cause large phenological mismatches whereby species that depend on one another become so separated in time that they can no longer interact. Our results suggest that climate change-induced phenological shifts can have a major impact on communities even in cases where complete phenological mismatches do not occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Coevolutionary models of the interactions between fruiting plants and avian seed dispersers have been influenced by the assumption that regurgitation and defecation of seeds have diffferent effects on seed coats, and consequently seed germination. We evaluated how the manner of seed processing affects seed germination by feeding fruits of three bird-dispersed shrubs, spicebush (Lindera benzoin), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), to captive cedar waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) and thrushes (Turdus migratorius, Hylocichla mustelina, Catharus guttatus and C. minimus).Cedar waxwings defecate all seeds, whereas thrushes regurgitate most seeds. For all three shrub species and all five bird species, there were no differences in germination success between seeds manually cleaned of pulp, and cleaned, bird-passed seeds, regardless of whether seeds were regurgitated or defecated. However, seeds of Lindera, and Prunus that were defecated by cedar waxwings and planted with feces, mimicking the depositional environment of defecated seeds in nature, suffered reduced germination relative to cleaned seeds. Thus, our results do not suggest that whether seeds are regurgitated or defecated is an important component of dispersal quality because of direct effects on the seed coat. Instead, seed processing modes differed in their effects on seed germination because of the feces associated with defecated seeds. Removal of fruit pulp from seeds by frugivores, a fundamental consequence of dispersal in animal guts, was critical for germination, especially for seeds within the lipid-rich fruits of Lindera and Viburnum. This suggests that for some fruiting plants, frugivores procide an essential service by freeing seeds from fruit pulp, in addition to their role in seed dispersal.},

abstract = {One of the central challenges of evolutionary biology is to understand how coevolution organizes biodiversity over complex geographic landscapes. Most species are collections of genetically differentiated populations, and these populations have the potential to become adapted to their local environments in different ways. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution incorporates this idea by proposing that spatial variation in natural selection and gene flow across a landscape can shape local coevolutionary dynamics(1-7). These effects may be particularly strong when populations differ across productivity gradients, where gene flow will often be asymmetric among populations(8). Conclusive empirical tests of this theory have been particularly difficult to perform because they require knowledge of patterns of gene flow, historical population relationships and local selection pressures(2). We have tested these predictions empirically using a model community of bacteria and bacteriophage ( viral parasitoids of bacteria). We show that gene flow across a spatially structured landscape alters coevolution of parasitoids and their hosts and that the resulting patterns of adaptation can fluctuate in both space and time.},

abstract = {The distribution of marsupial folivores in Australian eucalypt forests is extremely patchy and, although distribution patterns are known to be partly determined by nutritional factors, the role of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) has been little studied. We investigated variation in the foliar concentrations of five constituents: total phenolics (TP); the foliar component bound by polyethylene glycol (PEGBC); the formylphloroglucinol compound, sideroxylonal (a strong deterrent of mammalian herbivory); the terpene, cineole; and nitrogen (N). These constituents were analyzed using near infrared spectroscopy in 501 individual tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys) trees at 42 sites across a broad geographic range in eastern Australia. We tested three hypotheses: (1) trees with lower foliar N produce higher PSM concentrations; (2) PSM concentrations are greater at colder sites; and (3) PSM concentrations are higher at sites with low resource availability. Hypothesis I was true for all PSMs considered and was the result of variation that occurred within sites. This is consistent with the carbon/nutrient balance hypothesis and with the hypothesis that PSMs protect leaves from photodamage. Hypothesis 2 was upheld for all constituents. This was consistent with both the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, and with the hypothesis that PSMs represent an evolutionary adaptation to greater risks of photodamage and frost damage in cold environments'. Hypothesis 3 was rejected, with one PSM, sideroxylonal, being affected by resource availability in a manner opposite to that predicted. The optimal defense hypothesis offers an explanation for this result (as sideroxylonal concentrations increased along with the apparent nutritional quality of the foliage, possibly to provide defense against higher rates of herbivory). We found that trees associated with koala fecal pellets had lower concentrations, of sideroxylonal and cineole. We discuss this finding and further implications for the herbivores of Eucalyptus of the patterns of plant defense that we detected.},

Calculation of biomass from the flush requires that the proportion of CHCl3-killed cell C mineralized be known. To determine this proportion, 15 species of [14C]labelled fungi and 12 species of [14C]labelled bacteria were added to four types of soil and these were fumigated for 24 h with CHC13, reinoculated with unfumigated soil, and incubated at 22°C for 10 days. The average percentage mineralization of the fungi was 43.7 ± 5.3, while the average for the bacteria was 33.3 ± 9.9. Using a 1:3 ratio for distribution of total biomass between the bacterial and fungal populations, respectively, it was calculated that the average mineralization of both types of cells was 41.1{\%}. In experiments conducted to determine if CHC13 vapour alters stabilized microbial metabolites or dead microbial cells in a manner which makes them more susceptible to degradation, it was found that both fumigated and unfumigated dead fungal materials mineralized to the same extent in soil during 10 days of incubation.},

abstract = {Evolutionary adaptations require genetic variation in the traits concerned. Mountain birch populations suffer from regular autumnal moth defoliations that affect tree survival and growth. Earlier studies have found that birch individuals show clear differences in their leaf chemistry, which may be relevant to herbivore performance. A large part of this variation is assumed to be genetic, since quantitative differences between trees remain the same in different years. We estimated the genetic parameters of several herbivory-related chemical compounds. The material consisted of 30 mature wild trees and their progenies. We treated the data both as half-sib and full-sib families, and calculated parent-offspring comparisons as well. The compounds included 12 individual phenolics, 5 carbohydrates and 16 protein-bound amino acids. For comparison, we also analysed the weight and germination percent of seeds and the height of seedlings. Two of the most abundant phenylpropanoids (chlorogenic acid and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside) showed significant genetic variation, but this was not true of all individual phenolic compounds. Amino acids had less genetic variation than phenolic compounds. The high genetic variation of the phenolic compounds indicates that the mountain birch is able to evolve its phenol-based resistance.},

abstract = {1. In the tropics, many plants offer housing and food for their specialized ant partners which, in return, offer benefit in the form of defence and/or nutrients, thus forming mutualistic bonds. Such ant-plants, also called myrmecophytes, occur together at a local scale, generating community patterns of mutualistic ant-plant associations. Here, we present the first fully quantitative description of an ant-myrmecophyte community. 2. The study site in Central Amazonian tropical rainforest had a high myrmecophyte density of about 380 ind. ha(-1). Sixteen myrmecophyte and 25 ant species were recorded, the species abundance rank curves being highly uneven. 3. The ant-myrmecophyte matrix was highly compartmentalized, and a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the observed pattern was not a product of chance and sample size (P {\textless} 0 . 0001). Cluster analyses indicated that compartments were partially explained by occurrence of the ants in phylogenetically related host plants, but not by habitat specificity. 4. The connectance of the ant-plant community was 12{\%}. This value seems quite low when compared with published results from other mutualistic systems (pollinator and seed-disperser), after controlling for the total number of interacting species. The high frequency of null interactions in the ant-myrmecophyte system could not be explained by the 'phenological non-coincidence hypothesis', since both ant and plant partners occur together throughout the year. 5. Ant-plant interactions were highly asymmetrical: ant species had fewer partners than plant species and ants were more dependent on the plants than the reverse. These asymmetries are in the opposite direction to those recorded for plant-pollinators and plant-dispersers; however, they seem to be :he product of the same underlying process: differential fitness benefits between mutualistic partners. 6. The low number of ant and plant partners per compartment, coupled with an apparently high temporal and spatial stability of ant-myrmecophyte interactions, suggests that compartments are the appropriate scale at which to investigate coevolution in ant-myrmecophyte systems.},

Phenotypic plasticity in mutualistic interactions allows organisms to produce rewards to attract mutualists when the benefits of their presence outweigh the costs of producing the rewards. In ant-plant defensive mutualisms, defences are indirect as plants produce extra-floral nectaries (EFN) to attract predatory ants to deter herbivores. Here we demonstrate that in broad bean, Vicia faba, the overall number of EFNs on a plant increases dramatically following leaf damage. In two damage treatments, removal of: (1) one-third of one leaf in a single leaf pair or (2) one-third of both halves of a single leaf pair, resulted in a 59 and 106{\%} increase in the number of EFNs on the plants, respectively, over 1 week. We suggest that the increased production of visually conspicuous EFNs is an adaptive inducible response, to attract predatory arthropods when risk of herbivory increases.},

abstract = {1 Vegetation-environment relationships are well understood at the geographical scale, but it is still not clear what role chance and historical contigency play in the assembly of communities from the local species pool. We addressed this question experimentally by comparing the performance of congeneric species introduced into a grassland community. 2 We used the National Vegetation Classification and distribution maps to define the local pool of grassland species suited to our experimental site. From this we selected five pairs of congeneric species. One member of each pair was native to the experimental site ('present' species) and one member was represented in the local species pool but absent from the community ('absent' species). 3 If community assembly processes are deterministic, then absent species should underperform present congeners. Any other result would imply that chance, dispersal limitation or historical contingency plays a role in community assembly. Our experimental arrangement allowed us to assess the consistency of comparisons across different grazing treatment combinations. 4 Two field experiments were undertaken. The first investigated the effects of dispersal limitation by introducing seed of congeners and monitoring performance. The second investigated the survival of congeners introduced as small plants at the early stages of growth in 'plugs'. A laboratory germination test and a combined analysis of both field experiments were also undertaken. 5 Some species showed markedly different responses from their congeners in the two field experiments. Overall, the present species did not consistently perform better than their absent congeners. This indicates that the study community bears the strong imprint of dispersal limitation or other historical factors, a finding consistent with results previously obtained for the same community using a trait-based model. 6 We conclude that the accuracy of predictions about community composition will be limited by the success with which factors such as propagule dispersal and differential effects of seed predation and herbivory can be modelled. We predict the circumstances under which modelling of community assembly is most likely to be successful.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Biological mutualisms rely on communication between partners, but also require protective measures against exploitation. Animal-pollinated flowers need to attract pollinators but also to avoid conflicts with antagonistic consumers. The view of flower visitors as mutualistic and antagonistic agents considers primarily the plants' interest. A classification emphasizing the consumer's point of view, however, may be more useful when considering animal's adaptations to flower visits which may include a tolerance against defensive floral scent compounds.Methods In a meta-analysis covering 18 studies on the responses of animals to floral scents, the animals were assigned to the categories of obligate and facultative flower visitors which considers their dependency on floral resources. Their responses on floral scents were compared.Key Results On average, obligate flower visitors, often corresponding to pollinators, were attracted to floral scent compounds. In contrast, facultative and mainly antagonistic visitors were strongly repelled by floral scents. The findings confirm that floral scents have a dual function both as attractive and defensive cues.Conclusions Whether an animal depends on floral resources determines its response to these signals, suggesting that obligate flower visitors evolved a tolerance against primarily defensive compounds. Therefore, floral scent bouquets in conjunction with nutritious rewards may solve the conflicting tasks of attracting mutualists while repelling antagonists.},

abstract = {In the last few years a number of authors have suggested that evolution may be a so-called self-organized critical phenomenon, and that critical processes might have a significant effect on the dynamics of ecosystems. In particular it has been suggested that mass extinction may arise through a purely biotic mechanism as the result of 'coevolutionary avalanches'. In this paper we first explore the empirical evidence which has been put forward in favor of this conclusion. The data center principally around the existence of power-law functional forms in the distribution of the sizes of extinction events and other quantities. We then propose a new mathematical model of mass extinction which does not rely on coevolutionary effects and in which extinction is caused entirely by the action of environmental stress on species. In combination with a simple model of species adaption we show that this process can account for all the observed data without the need to invoke coevolution and critical processes. The model also makes some independent predictions, such as the existence of 'aftershock' extinctions in the aftermath of large mass extinction events, which should in theory be testable against the fossil record.

The phylogenetic relationships of fig wasps pollinating functionally dioecious Ficus were inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene sequences (mtDNA) and morphology. Separate and combined analyses indicated that the pollinators of functionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic. However, pollinator relationships were generally congruent with host phylogeny and support a revised classification of Ficus. Ancestral changes in pollinator ovipositor length also correlated with changes in fig breeding systems. In particular, the relative elongation of the ovipositor was associated with the repeated loss of functionally dioecious pollination. The concerted evolution of interacting morphologies may bias estimates of phylogeny based on female head characters, but homoplasy is not so strong in other morphological traits. The lesser phylogenetic utility of morphology than of mtDNA is not due to rampant convergence in morphology but rather to the greater number of potentially informative characters in DNA sequence data; patterns of nucleotide substitution also limit the utility of mtDNA findings. Nonetheless, inferring the ancestral associations of fig pollinators from the best-supported phylogeny provided strong evidence of host conservatism in this highly specialized mutualism.},

abstract = {Because coevolution takes place across a broad scale of time and space, it is virtually impossible to understand its dynamics and trajectories by studying a single pair of interacting populations at one time. Comparing populations across a range of an interaction, especially for long-lived species, can provide insight into these features of coevolution by sampling across a diverse set of conditions and histories. We used measures of prey traits (tetrodotoxin toxicity in newts) and predator traits (tetrodotoxin resistance of snakes) to assess the degree of phenotypic mismatch across the range of their coevolutionary interaction. Geographic patterns of phenotypic exaggeration were similar in prey and predators, with most phenotypically elevated localities occurring along the central Oregon coast and central California. Contrary to expectations, however, these areas of elevated traits did not coincide with the most intense coevolutionary selection. Measures of functional trait mismatch revealed that over one-third of sampled localities were so mismatched that reciprocal selection could not occur given current trait distributions. Estimates of current locality-specific interaction selection gradients confirmed this interpretation. In every case of mismatch, predators were "ahead" of prey in the arms race; the converse escape of prey was never observed. The emergent pattern suggests a dynamic in which interacting species experience reciprocal selection that drives arms-race escalation of both prey and predator phenotypes at a subset of localities across the interaction. This coadaptation proceeds until the evolution of extreme phenotypes by predators, through genes of large effect, allows snakes to, at least temporarily, escape the arms race.},

abstract = {Terrestrial plants respond in complex ways to the interaction of stress and herbivory, but much less is known about responses of seaweeds. We studied the common intertidal rockweed Fuctis gardneri to determine how stress and herbivory interact to influence its survival, growth, reproduction, and the concentration of phlorotannins, which can deter herbivory and constitute substantial mass. We manipulated stress and herbivory both in the field and in outdoor mesocosms over 2-4 months during spring and summer. In the field, disruptive stress was reduced in the upper range of the seaweed's distribution with awnings made of screen. Temperatures and relative humidities were more extreme in the no-awnings locations. This treatment was crossed with a limpet-removal treatment. In mesocosms, the tidal period was controlled so that half of the experimental thalli were exposed to air daily for 3-4 hours longer (greater limitation stress) than the other half, and three levels of isopod grazing were maintained. Grazing intensity was effectively reduced in the field and increased in the mesocosms. Net rates of photosynthesis were used as independent measures of seaweed stress. Fucus gardneri in the locations without awnings exhibited significant reductions in net photosynthesis, survival, and final size compared to thalli under awnings. The mesocosm environment was more benign; all individuals survived longer and grew larger. However, results from both experiments were generally consistent. Stress resulted in slightly lower growth and substantially reduced phlorotannin mass. Severe stress had a negative effect on reproductive output in the field experiment, but mild stress had a small positive effect in the mesocosms. Herbivory resulted in reduced thallus mass, slightly reduced growth, and reduced reproduction, but it had no effect on phlorotannin levels in either experiment. Herbivory and stress thus influenced different performance indicators in Fucus. Stress had more dramatic effects on phlorotannins than it did on growth, whereas herbivory more strongly influenced growth and reproduction. Few interactive effects were found, unlike in many terrestrial studies. If stress and herbivory act largely independently, as they appear to do here and in the limited number of other seaweed studies, predicting the effects of changes in the intertidal physical environment and in herbivory might be simpler than anticipated. The physiological basis for the observed responses to stress and herbivory is suspected to involve trade-offs in resource allocation among these key life-history parameters.},

abstract = {Arboreal frugivores. such as primates and hornbills, are important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species, yet the degree to which they use the same resources is unknown. If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species. they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers. and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantified the feeding habits of two hornbill species. Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and five primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share. often leading to inflated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages. with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identified two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at significantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year. overlap between groups (hornbill-primate) was significantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate-primate and hornbill-hornbill). showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers. In equatorial Africa, primate populations face greater declines than hornbill populations because of hunting. It is unlikely that seed dispersal by hornbills will compensate for the loss of primates in maintaining forest structure.},

To reduce the adverse effects of this on ecology, hydrology and fisheries interests a river management strategy needs to be able to predict where and when grazing pressure will be greatest. To assess the suitability of mathematical modelling for this purpose, an individual-based model (IBM) was constructed and tested for swans grazing a 1.1km length of the River Frome and adjacent pasture land in Dorset, England. Comparison of predicted and observed data indicates that the model was good at estimating the number of swan days, macrophyte biomass depletion, swan feeding time and feeding patch use. The results indicate that IBMs used at the appropriate scale could help to reconcile river management conflicts involving swans.},

abstract = {Pollinator-mediated selection is one of the most important factors driving adaptation in flowering plants. However, as ecological conditions change through habitat loss and fragmentation, the interactions among species may evolve in new and unexpected directions. Human-induced environmental variation is likely to affect selection regimes, but as yet no empirical examples have been reported. In the study reported here, we examined the influence of human-induced habitat transformation on the composition of pollinator assemblages and, hence, pollinator-mediated selection on the flower phenotype of Viola portalesia (Violaceae). Our results indicate that pollinator assemblages differed substantially in terms of species composition and visitation rate between nearby native and transformed habitats. Similarly, the insect species that contributed most to visitation rates differed between plant populations. While the magnitude and sign of pollinator-mediated selection on flower length and width did not differ between sites, selection for flower number lost significance in the transformed habitat, and a significant pattern of disruptive selection for flower shape, undetected in the native habitat, was present in the transformed one. Overall, the results of this study suggest that human-induced habitat change may not only modify the species composition of pollinator assemblages, relaxing the selection process on some flower characters, but they may also create new opportunities for fitness-trait covariation not present in pristine conditions.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal predictability in the mutual selective pressures of plants and frugivorous birds is a prerequisite for coevolution to occur. I examine the interaction patterns of strongly frugivorous thrushes (Turdus spp.) and their major winter food plants (Juniperus spp., Cupressaceae) and how they vary in space and time. Spatial congruency, rarely considered in seed dispersal studies, is studied at three spatial scales: 1) the total species range; 2) regional distribution; and 3) local abundance and its variation between seasons. Southern Spanish frugivorous thrushes and junipers show very low congruence,in distribution patterns at each of these scales. Most juniper species show geographic distributions that are nested within the geographic ranges of thrush species. Bird species showed greater habitat breadth values than plants and were found in a greater percentage of localities. The local bird abundance was strongly correlated across years and sites with the local availability of juniper cones. Cone production varied markedly between years, but the rankings for different species in different years were statistically concordant at mid-elevation and lowland sites. Both bird abundance and cone production showed greater temporal than spatial variability. Variation of cone productions at both temporal and spatial scales was greater than variability in bird abundance. Species with strong interactions of mutual dependence showed very low values of biogeographic congruence, caused by differences in geographic range and habitat specificity. This obviously limits the possibilities for pairwise, specific coevolution to occur. However, mutual effects of species groups are possible to the extent that the component species are ecologically 'interchangeable' in their selective effects and other constraints on coevolution are not operating. The approach used here to examine the patterns of species interactions at different biogeographic scales might prove useful in comparative studies of plant-animal interactions.},

abstract = {Conflicts of interest are common to mutualisms, particularly those derived from exploitative interactions. Conflicts of interest are particularly pronounced in pollination/seed predation mutualisms, such as moth/yucca interactions, where consumption of seeds by larvae of a plant's pollinator will raise the fitness of the pollinator but lower the fitness of the plant. A central question in these mutualisms is, therefore, 'what limits seed predation?' If plants with excess flowers selectively abscise flowers containing many eggs, they may reduce seed predation and overall increase their fecundity. If eggs in abscised flowers die, selective abscission may additionally contribute to the limitation or regulation of pollinator populations, thereby decreasing the probability of future overexploitation.We examined the effect of selective abscission in the mutualism between Yucca kanabensis and one of its pollinating moths, Tegeticula altiplanella. Per capita mortality of moth eggs due to abscission was high (95.5{\%}), but did not increase on inflorescences with more ovipositions per flower. Overall mortality was partitioned into two components based upon the proportion of visited flowers abscised (i.e. resource-limitation) and additional mortality (=selective abscission). Resource-limitation per se inflicted 93.9{\%} egg mortality, or most of the mortality due to abscission. But, the average number of eggs in fruit was lower than the average number of eggs in flowers, indicating that there was some selectivity of abscission. However, neither source of mortality increased on inflorescences with more ovipositions per visited flower. Egg mortality resulting from selective abscission was not as high as possible, because the yuccas appeared to use oviposition-damaged ovules as a cue for selective abscission, and there was considerable variation in the relationship between oviposition number and damaged ovules. However, even if yuccas had retained the flowers containing the fewest eggs, selective abscission still would not have been higher on inflorescences with more ovipositions per flower.Considering also that, 1) number of ovipositions is a poor predictor of the number of larvae that hatch and feed on the developing seeds in a fruit and that, 2) there are several moth/yucca interactions in which selective abscission does not occur, we conclude that abscission, and particular selective abscission, may have density-limiting effects on moth populations, but will fail as general explanations for regulating the dynamics of moth populations.},

A small insert genomic library of the bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) was constructed and screened for the presence of(CA/GT)(n), and (GA/CT)(n) repeats. The proportion of positive clones yielded estimates of 3 x 10(5) such dinucleotide repeats per genome, roughly comparable to abundances reported in other eukaryotic genomes. Thirteen positive clones were sequenced. In contrast to mammalian genomes, the (CA/CT)(n), motif was more abundant than the (CA/GT)(n), motif in these clones. The (GA/CT)(n), repeats also showed longer average repeat length (mean n=16.2 versus 7.3), suggesting that they are better candidates for yielding polymorphic genetic markers in oak genomes. Indeed, a survey of adult bur oaks and offspring in a small stand in northern Illinois at 3 of these (GA/CT)(n), microsatellite loci revealed Mendelian inheritance and extremely high levels of polymorphism, with the number of alleles at each locus ranging from 11-20 and heterozygosity ranging from 0.66 to 0.75. These results, indicating that (GA/CT)(n) microsatellites are both abundant and highly polymorphic in the bur oak genome, suggest that such genetic markers have tremendous potential for applications for studies of parentage, pollination and dispersal in temperate trees.},

Models predict that mutualists might often evolve into parasites, can abandon their partners to live autonomously and are also vulnerable to extinction. Yet a basic empirical question, whether mutualisms commonly break down, has been mostly overlooked. As we discuss here, recent progress in molecular systematics helps address this question. Newly constructed phylogenies reveal that parasites as well as autonomous (non-mutualist) taxa are nested within ancestrally mutualistic clades. Although models have focused on the propensity of mutualism to become parasitic, such shifts appear relatively rarely. By contrast, diverse systems exhibit reversions to autonomy, and this might be a common and unexplored endpoint to mutualism.},

Distinctive spores of the dung fungus Sporornziella are used as a proxy for megafaunal biomass, and charcoal particle analysis as a proxy for fire history. A decline in spore values at all sites is closely followed by a stratigraphic charcoal rise. It is inferred that the regional collapse of a megaherbivory regime was followed by landscape transformation by humans. Correlation with the pollen stratigraphy indicates these developments began many centuries in advance of the Younger Dryas climatic reversal at the end of the Pleistocene. However, throughout the region, the latest bone collagen dates for Mannnut are considerably later, suggesting that megaherbivores lasted until the beginning of the Younger Dryas, well after initial population collapse. This evidence is consistent with the interpretation that rapid overkill on the part of humans initiated the extinction process. Landscape transformation and climate change then may have contributed to a cascade of effects that culminated in the demise of all the largest members of North America's mammal fauna.},

We examined how variation in resource abundance (forest area of lodgepole pine Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) influenced patterns of co-adaptation and coevolution between red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex) and lodgepole pine populations. First, we found that crossbill abundance increased logarithmically as forest area increased in mountain ranges lacking a preemptive competitor (pine squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Second, seed defences against predation by crossbills increased with increases in crossbill density, suggesting that seed defences have likely evolved in proportion to the intensity of selection that crossbills exert. Third, the average bill size of crossbill populations increased with increasing seed defences, which implies that crossbill offenses increased with increases in seed defences. The large bill size on the largest range is the result of coevolution with lodgepole pine with this crossbill population perhaps speciating. Local adaptation of crossbill populations on smaller ranges, however, is more likely the result of resident crossbills representing a subset of the potential colonists (phenotypic sorting) than of local evolution. In the smallest range, migration and possibly more frequent extinction likely impede local adaptation and may result in maladaptation.},

We studied within-fruit distributions of four seed types (fertile, infertile, eaten and uneaten seeds) in order to evaluate costs and benefits in a Yucca schottii population in southeastern Arizona. We focused on how the spatial arrangement of seeds affected larval behaviour and, hence, the costs of the mutualism to the yucca. Infertile seeds were distributed throughout both infested and uninfested locules. Additionally, moth larvae feeding in a single locule preferred fertile seeds and even avoided infertile seeds and left the fruit significantly more often when they encountered infertile seeds. We suggest that, regardless of the cause of infertile seeds, they function as blocking units within seed locules and therefore reduce seed predation by moth larvae. We also suggest that, together with certain other fruit traits, the presence of infertile seeds promotes the evolutionary stability of this pollination mutualism.},

abstract = {Mutualistic interactions almost always produce both costs and benefits for each of the interacting species. It is the difference between gross benefits and costs that determines the net benefit and the per-capita effect on each of the interacting populations. For example, the net benefit of obligate pollinators. such as yucca and senita moths, to plants is determined by the difference between the number of ovules fertilized from moth pollination and the number of ovules eaten by the pollinator's larvae. It is clear that if pollinator populations are large, then, because many eggs are laid, costs to plants are large, whereas, if pollinator populations are small, gross benefits are low due to lack of pollination. Even though the size and dynamics of the pollinator population are likely to be crucial, their importance has been neglected in the investigation of mechanisms, such as selective fruit abortion, that can limit costs and increase net benefits. Here, we suggest that both the population size and dynamics of pollinators are important in determining the net benefits to plants, and that fruit abortion can significantly affect these. We develop a model of mutualism between populations of plants and their pollinating seed-predators to explore the ecological consequences of fruit abortion on pollinator population dynamics and the net effect on plants. We demonstrate that the benefit to a plant population is unimodal as a function of pollinator abundance, relative to the abundance of flowers. Both selective abortion of fruit with eggs and random abortion of fruit, without reference to whether they have eggs or not, can limit pollinator population size. This can increase the net benefits to the plant population by limiting the number of eggs laid, if the pollination rate remains high. However, fruit abortion can possibly destabilize the pollinator population, with negative consequences for the plant population.},

abstract = {The structure of mutualistic networks provides clues to processes shaping biodiversity [1-10]. Among them, interaction intimacy, the degree of biological association between partners, leads to differences in specialization patterns [4, 11) and might affect network organization [12]. Here, we investigated potential consequences of interaction intimacy for the structure and coevolution of mutualistic networks. From observed processes of selection on mutualistic interactions, it is expected that symbiotic interactions (high-interaction intimacy) will form species-poor networks characterized by compartmentalization [12,13], whereas nonsymbiotic interactions (low intimacy) will lead to species-rich, nested networks in which there is a core of generalists and specialists often interact with generalists [3, 5, 7,12,14]. We demonstrated an association between interaction intimacy and structure in 19 ant-plant mutualistic networks. Through numerical simulations, we found that network structure of different forms of mutualism affects evolutionary change in distinct ways. Change in one species affects primarily one mutualistic partner in symbiotic interactions but might affect multiple partners in nonsymbiotic interactions. We hypothesize that coevolution in symbiotic interactions is characterized by frequent reciprocal changes between few partners, but coevolution in nonsymbiotic networks might show rare bursts of changes in which many species respond to evolutionary changes in a single species.},

abstract = {Exploring the factors governing the maintenance and breakdown of cooperation between mutualists is an intriguing and enduring problem for evolutionary ecology, and symbioses between ants and plants can provide useful experimental models for such studies. Hundreds of tropical plant species have evolved structures to house and feed ants, and these ant-plant symbioses have long been considered classic examples of mutualism. Here, we report that the primary ant symbiont, Allomerus cf. demerarae, of the most abundant ant-plant found in south-east Peru, Cordia nodosa Lam., castrates its host plant. Allomerus workers protect new leaves and their associated domatia from herbivory, but destroy flowers, reducing fruit production to zero in most host plants. Castrated plants occupied by Allomerus provide more domatia for their associated ants than plants occupied by three species of Azteca ants that do not castrate their hosts. Allomerus colonies in larger plants have higher fecundity. As a consequence, Allomerus appears to benefit from its castration behaviour, to the detriment of C. nodosa. The C. nodosa-ant system exhibits none of the retaliatory or filtering mechanisms shown to stabilize cheating in other cooperative systems, and appears to persist because some of the plants, albeit a small;minority, are inhabited by the three species of truly mutualistic Azteca ants.},

abstract = {Plant--animal mutualisms are characterized by weak or asymmetric mutual dependences between interacting species, a 
feature that could increase community stability. If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web 
structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of 
plant--pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting 
species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant--pollinator webs, eight from 
forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded 
webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of 
a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. 
The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from 
generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native 
species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of 
alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics. },

abstract = {We introduce the Webworld model, which links together the ecological modelling of food web structure with the evolutionary modelling of speciation and extinction events. The model describes dynamics of ecological communities on an evolutionary time-scale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic features, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between species. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external environment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean population sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new species is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species and a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add stably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly adapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to competition for resources.We measure various properties of the model webs and compare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the proportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per species and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary dynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total number of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms arise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss these results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil record, and to the theory of self-organized criticality. (C) 1998 Academic Press},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. The huge diversity of symbiotic associations among animals and/or plants comprises both mutualisms and parasitisms. Most symbioses between social insect species, however, involve social parasites, while mutual benefits have been only suspected for some parabiotic associations - two colonies that share a nest.2. In the rainforest of Borneo, we studied parabiotic associations between the ants Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur. Parabiotic nests were regularly found inside hollow tree trunks, most likely initiated by Cr. modiglianii. This species frequently nested without its partner, whereas we never found non-parabiotic Ca. rufifemur nests. We experimentally investigated potential benefits, potential interference competition for food (as a probable cost), and foraging niches of both species.3. The two species never showed aggressive interactions and amicably shared food resources. However, Cr. modiglianii had a wider temporal and spatial foraging range than Ca. rufifemur, always found baits before Ca. rufifemur and recruited more efficiently. Camponotus rufifemur probably benefited from following pheromone trails of Cr. modiglianii. In turn, Ca. rufifemur was significantly more successful in defending the nest against alien ants. Crematogaster modiglianii hence may profit from its partner's defensive abilities.4. In neotropical parabioses, epiphytes grown in 'ant-gardens' play a crucial role in the association, e.g. by stabilization of nests. Hemiepiphytic Poikilospermum cordifolium (Cecropiaceae) seedlings and saplings frequently grew in the entrances of parabiotic nests in Borneo, obviously dispersed by the ants. In cafeteria experiments, both parabiotic ants carried its elaiosome-bearing seeds into the nest. However, P. cordifolium does not provide additional nest space, contrasting with neotropical ant-gardens.5. The parabiotic association appears beneficial for both ant species, the main benefits being nest initiation by Cr. modiglianii and interspecific trail-following (for Ca. rufifemur), and, in turn, nest defence by Ca. rufifemur (for Cr. modiglianii). However, Ca. rufifemur seems to be more dependent on its partner than vice versa.},

abstract = {Seed packaging is one fruit characteristic that may influence post-ingestional fruit processing in avian frugivores. We tested the response of a facultative frugivore, the Silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), to fruit containing different forms of seed packaging. Wild-caught, captive Silvereyes were presented with artificial fruit containing either one large seed or three small seeds of equivalent total volume, and their consumption rates were recorded over 90 min. In a second experiment, the seed transit times (ingestion to excretion) for similar large-seeded and small-seeded fruit consumed by Silvereyes were recorded. Silvereyes consumed significantly more large-seeded fruit than small-seeded fruit. The transit time of seeds was also significantly shorter for large-seeded (mean = 22 min) than for small-seeded fruit (mean = 29 min). Thus seed packaging had a significant influence on the rate at which fruit were processed. Silvereyes were able to consume more large-seeded than small-seeded fruit because the seeds in large-seeded fruit were defecated faster than those in small-seeded fruit. It is likely that Silvereyes can compensate for the costs of seed ingestion through having a rapid gut passage rate and hence an increased fruit consumption rate. The gut of Silvereyes showed morphological characters intermediate between insectivores and specialist frugivores. The dimensions of the intestine and gizzard were like those of insectivores and the gizzard was substantially larger than those of specialist frugivores. Facultative frugivores appear to have few morphological adaptations to frugivory and we argue that this facilitates plasticity in the diet and the processing of insects when fruit is not available.},

abstract = {Aim Large herbivores have important effects upon Paleotropical ecosystems, but attain much lower biomass densities in the Neotropics. We assess how this difference in herbivore activity has generated different ecological and evolutionary trajectories in the New and Old World tropics. We also propose an explanation for how the greater biomass density in the Old World came about. Location Data were compiled primarily from moist tropical forests, although more of the relevant information to address most of our hypotheses was available from the mainland areas of Africa, Asia, and South America than elsewhere. Methods We gleaned data from published information and personal communication. We compared body masses and a variety of other types of information for the New- and Old- World tropics. We proposed that interhemispheric differences exist in a variety of processes, including herbivory, frugivory, and flower visitation. We erected hypotheses and evaluated them qualitatively, and, when information was available, tested them using simple ratios of species in various taxonomic and trophic categories. To make the comparisons more meaningful, we specified appropriate data selection criteria. Results A general pattern of differences emerges from this review. Compared with Neotropical forests, the much greater biomass densities of large herbivores in Paleotropical forests are associated with a lesser diversity of small herbivores, different hunting methods used by indigenous humans, larger arboreal vertebrates, larger fruits, different patterns of fruit and flower dispersion in space and time, a lesser abundance of most types of reproductive plant parts, and other features. The existence of a species-rich fauna of large herbivores in the pre-Holocene Neotropical rain forest was not supported. Main conclusions The potential for large herbivores to cause functional differences between the New and Old World tropical forests has been virtually unexplored, despite the well-known importance of large herbivores in the Old World tropics. The evaluations of our hypotheses suggest that the abundance of large herbivores in the Old World tropics has launched it onto a different evolutionary trajectory than that of the NewWorld tropics. The relevant evidence, although scanty, suggests that the interhemispheric ecological differences are not an artefact of recent megafaunal extinctions in the New World. Recent human activities have, however, reduced population sizes of large wild herbivores in the Old World, and increased population sizes of livestock. This has likely created a rather homogeneous, anthropogenic selection pressure that tends to erase the evolutionary differences between the two tropical worlds.},

We test the hypothesis that among-population variation in blossom morphology is due largely to local adaptation to avoid competition from other species of Dalechampia that utilize the same restricted set of pollinators. Because direct phylogenetic and historical information are unavailable for these populations, we develop a novel comparative method for the study of adaptation to a spatially distributed selective factor in spatially correlated populations. In addition to providing spatially, or phylogenetically, corrected estimates of selective effects, the method assesses the local specificity of adaptations. We find evidence for moderately strong local specificity of adaptation among our populations, and furthermore we find that the effects of putative competitors are in accordance with predictions from a hypothesis of character displacement. However, sympatry or allopatry explains only 10{\%}-20{\%} of the interpopulation variation in blossom morphology, and we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that some other selective factors are major determinants of the variation.},

abstract = {Because herbivory is more intense in the tropics, tropical seaweeds may be better defended against herbivory than are temperate seaweeds. A ''diffuse'' coevolutionary corollary to this hypothesis is that tropical herbivores should be more resistant to seaweed defenses than temperate herbivores because tropical herbivores more commonly encounter heavily defended seaweeds. We begin to test the latter prediction using three newly discovered diterpenoid secondary metabolites from the tropical brown alga Dictyota acutiloba. We tested the feeding deterrent properties of these compounds against common herbivorous fishes and sea urchins from warm-temperate North Carolina versus tropical Guam using standardized laboratory feeding assays. The temperate herbivores were deterred by lower concentrations of secondary metabolites than the tropical herbivores. In no case was a tropical herbivore more deterred by a compound than a temperate herbivore, suggesting that temperate herbivores may be more strongly affected by seaweed chemical defenses. Feeding by the temperate pinfish Lagodon rhomboides was significantly reduced by two of the three diterpenes at a concentration that was only 13-18 {\%} of the natural concentration found in the alga. Feeding by four species of tropical fishes (two parrotfishes and two surgeonfishes) was unaffected by metabolite concentrations that deterred the temperate fish. At 100{\%} of natural concentrations, only one of the three compounds deterred the two parrotfishes, and none of the three compounds deterred the surgeonfishes. Contrasts between the temperate sea urchin Arbacia punctulata and the tropical sea urchin Diadema savignyi showed a similar pattern; low concentrations of acutilol A acetate strongly deterred the temperate, but not the tropical, urchin. Tropical herbivores appear more resistant than temperate herbivores to seaweed chemical defenses.},

The specificity of host resistance and parasitoid virulence is thus a key factor in host-parasitoid coevolution. A continuum of strategies exists, from strict specificity to a generalist strategy. The optimal level of specificity may differ in host and parasitoid. I investigated the optimal level of resistance specificity using a model in which the host could be attacked by two parasitoid species, with variable levels of defense specificity. The fitness of a parasitoid attacking two host species with different levels of virulence specificity was also modeled. Finally, a fluctuating environment was simulated by introducing variable probabilities of encounters between antagonistic species over several generations. If the frequency of encounters with the antagonistic species is fixed, then both host and parasitoid gain from a strategy of exclusive specialization toward the most frequent antagonist. If the frequency of encounters fluctuates between generations, generalist host resistance and partially specialist parasitoid virulence are favored. Generalist host resistance may be considered to be a bet-hedging response to an unpredictable environment. This asymmetry in host-parasitoid coevolution may account for some of the genetic structures observed in the field for host-parasitoid associations.},

abstract = {Some species of animals provide directed dispersal of plant seeds by transporting them nonrandomly to microsites where their chances of producing healthy seedlings are enhanced. We investigated whether this mutualistic interaction occurs between granivorous rodents and Jeffrey pine ( Pinus jeffreyi) in the eastern Sierra Nevada by comparing the effectiveness of random abiotic seed dispersal with the dispersal performed by four species of rodents: deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus), yellow-pine and long-eared chipmunks ( Tamias amoenus and T. quadrimaculatus), and golden-mantled ground squirrels ( Spermophilus lateralis). We conducted two caching studies using radio-labeled seeds, the. first with individual animals in. field enclosures and the second with a community of rodents in open forest. We used artificial caches to compare the fates of seeds placed at the range of microsites and depths used by animals with the fates of seeds dispersed abiotically. Finally, we examined the distribution and survival of naturally establishing seedlings over an eight-year period.Several lines of evidence suggested that this community of rodents provided directed dispersal. Animals preferred to cache seeds in microsites that were favorable for emergence or survival of seedlings and avoided caching in microsites in which seedlings fared worst. Seeds buried at depths typical of animal caches (5-25 mm) produced at least. five times more seedlings than did seeds on the forest. floor. The four species of rodents differed in the quality of dispersal they provided. Small, shallow caches made by deer mice most resembled seeds dispersed by abiotic processes, whereas many of the large caches made by ground squirrels were buried too deeply for successful emergence of seedlings. Chipmunks made the greatest number of caches within the range of depths and microsites favorable for establishment of pine seedlings. Directed dispersal is an important element of the population dynamics of Jeffrey pine, a dominant tree species in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Quantifying the occurrence and dynamics of directed dispersal in this and other cases will contribute to better understanding of mutualistic coevolution of plants and animals and to more effective management of ecosystems in which directed dispersal is a keystone process.},

abstract = {Plant-animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6{\%}) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2{\%}) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.},

Naturally occurring seedlings were measured for height, leaf number and standing levels of leaf damage by herbivores and pathogens. Thereafter, seedlings were exposed for 1 y to three litter treatments: (1) litter addition, (2) control and (3) continuous litter removal. There was a significant effect of site on the proportion of surviving seedlings and on the relative growth rates in terms of leaf number. Overall, seedlings with higher initial leaf number showed higher survival and produced more leaves after 12 mo than seedlings with lower initial leaf number. Litter addition resulted in seedlings with lower relative growth rates in height and higher levels of damage by herbivores and pathogens. On average, leaf area damaged by pathogens was {\textless} 6{\%} and herbivory was {\textless} 27{\%}. Seedlings with higher levels of herbivory showed higher levels of pathogen attack. Herbivory and pathogen attack had no effect on seedling performance.

abstract = {Generalized, facultative mutualisms are often characterized by great variation in the benefits provided by different partner species. This variation may be due to differences among species,in the quality and quantity of their interactions, as well as their phenology. Many plant species produce extrafloral nectar, a carbohydrate-rich resource, to attract ant species that can act as ``bodyguards'' against a plant's natural enemies. Here, we explore differences in the quality and quantity of protective service that ants can provide a plant by contrasting the four most common ant visitors to Ferocactus wislizeni, an extrafloral nectary-bearing cactus in southern Arizona. The four species differ in abundance when tending plants, and in the frequency at which they visit plants. By adding surrogate herbivores (Manduca sexta caterpillars) to plants, we demonstrate that all four species recruit to and attack potential herbivores. However, their per capita effectiveness in deterring herbivores (measured as the inverse of the number of workers needed to remove half of the experimentally added caterpillars) differs. Using these among-species differences in quality (per capita effectiveness) and quantity (number of workers that visit a plant and frequency of visitation), we accurately predicted the variation in fruit production among plants with different histories of ant tending. We found that plant benefits (herbivore removal and maturation of buds and fruits) typically saturated at high levels of ant protection, although plants could be ``well defended'' via different combinations of interaction frequency, numbers of ant workers per interaction, and per capita effects. Our study documents variation among prospective mutualists, distinguishes the components of this variation, and integrates these components into a predictive measure of protection benefit to the plant. The method we used to average saturating benefits over time could prove useful for quantifying overall service in other mutualisms.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, frugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and postdispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover. Similarly, the magnitude of frugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal can be advantageous (1) in escape from density- or distance-dependent seed and seedling mortality, (2) by colonization of suitable sites unpredictable in space and time, and (3) by directed dispersal to particular sites with a relatively high probability of survival. Most previous research on the consequences of seed dispersal has focused on escape and colonization because adaptations ensuring directed dispersal are not expected under the paradigm of diffuse mutualism that characterizes the modern view of seed dispersal evolution. In this paper, I suggest that directed dispersal is more common than previously believed even in the absence of plant adaptations to promote it. Directed dispersal may be seen in particular among animal-dispersed plants and in arid ecosystems or successional areas, but has been overlooked due to the lack of detailed data on seed shadows generated by particular species, and the fact that the alternative advantages of dispersal are not mutually exclusive. Although directed dispersal is never thought to be the only advantage of dispersal, it may often be ecologically important if one dispersal vector has a disproportionate effect on plant recruitment. Furthermore, in human-disturbed and managed ecosystems, directed dispersal may be important in restoration. More studies detailing the consequences of different patterns of seed dispersal will be useful for conservation and management strategies.},

However, many parasites are generalists in that they parasitize more than one host species (often many more) and establish associations with other hosts that cannot be described as true parasitism, We identify such an association, explain how constraints may maintain it, and indicate why such diffuse interactions are deserving of attention. We describe the use of two closely related Sympetrum dragonfly species by larvae of the water mite Arrenurus planus Marshall. Adults of one dragonfly species are resistant whereas adults of the other species are almost wholly susceptible to A, planus. However, A. planus attaches as often to the resistant host as it does to the susceptible host species when relative abundance and seasonal timing of adult emergence of both species is considered, We present evidence that mites track the susceptible host and are most active early in the season, when early-emerging unsuitable hosts are also present. Thus, use of resistant hosts appears an unavoidable outcome of constraints promoting discovery and use of susceptible hosts. Such findings have implications for studies of local adaptation and host switching.},

We studied pollinator-mediated selection in four populations of Nierembergia linariifolia, a self-incompatible and oil-secreting plant pollinated exclusively by oil-collecting bees. We evaluated whether floral traits experience variable selection among populations and whether attraction and fit traits are heterogeneously selected across populations. Populations differed in every flower trait and selection was consistently observed for corolla size and flower shape, two traits involved in the first steps of the pollination process. However, we found no selection acting on mechanical-fit traits. The observation that selection occurred upon attraction rather than mechanical-fit traits, suggests that plants are not currently evolving fine-tuned morphological adaptations to local pollinators and that phenotypic matching is not necessarily an expected outcome in this specialized pollination system.},

Until recently, it was assumed that there was a short window of time during which a fig crop could be pollinated. Hence, pollination of figs was thought to depend on extreme efficiency of the wasps in locating receptive trees. In that context, extensive data on the Costa Rican fig tree Ficus pertusa L. have been very difficult to understand. In I: pertusa, figs of different crops attract wasps at different stages of their development. The crops that attract wasps the earliest in their development are the most heavily visited ones, but mature the fewest pollinator offspring and seeds on a per-fig basis. Using simulation models of pollinator population dynamics and field data, we show that (i) attractiveness of a crop is prolonged, (ii) wasps prefer large figs when given a choice, and (iii) the observed pattern of preferential early visitation of crops can be explained by temporal variations in pollinator abundance. This emphasizes the importance of population-level mechanisms to explain the fig/fig wasp mutualism.},

abstract = {Bears consuming wild fruits for fall energy accumulation are constrained by several factors, including intake rate, the physiological capacity of the gastrointestinal tract, and the metabolic efficiency of gain in body mass. We measured these relationships through foraging and feeding trials using captive and wild black bears (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). Four fruit types covering a range of sizes and clustering were offered to captive bears to determine the effect of density, size, and presentation on intake rate. Intake rate (in grams per minute) and bite rates (in bites per minute) increased curvilinearly with increasing fruit density in singly spaced fruits. Maximum intakes ranged from 30 g/min for 0.5-g berries to {\textgreater} 200 g/min for 4.2-g fruits. The highest bite rates were obtained during the initial encounter with each patch as bears consumed all visually apparent fruits on the surface. Bite rates quickly dropped by 15-20{\%} as foraging continued within the patch. Maximum bite rates were not depressed until initial fruit density fell to {\textless} 50 berries/m(3). Maximum daily fresh fruit intake for the captive bears averaged 34 +/- 6{\%} (mean +/- 1 SD) of body mass. The dry-matter digestibility of wild fruits, particularly preferred species, was as high as 72{\%}. While large captive bears could gain body mass very rapidly when given fruit ad libitum, foraging efficiencies increasingly constrained growth rates of wild bears {\textgreater} 100 kg. We concluded that large bears, such as grizzlies, must depend on plants that permit large bite sizes or high bite rates through fruit clustering and bush configuration that reduce leaf-to-fruit ratios.},

The central principle is to consider a particular gene tree as a variable to be optimized in the estimation of a given population statistic. We propose three population statistics that are related to variance components and that are explicit functions of phylogenetic information. The methodology is applied in the context of minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and human mitochondrial DNA restriction data, but could be extended to accommodate other tree-making procedures, as well as other data types. We pursue optimal trees by heuristic optimization over a search space of more than 1.29 billion MSTs. This very large number of equally parsimonious trees underlines the lack of resolution of conventional parsimony procedures. This lack of resolution is highlighted by the observation that equally parsimonious trees yield very different estimates of population genetic diversity and genetic structure, as shown by null distributions of the population statistics, obtained by evaluation of 10,000 random MSTs. We propose a non-parametric test for the similarity between any two trees, based on the distribution of a weighted coevolutionary correlation. The ability to test for tree relatedness leads to the definition of a class of solutions instead of a single solution. Members of the class share virtually all of the critical internal structure of the tree but differ in the placement of singleton branch tips.},

We performed an experiment to determine the effects of seed ingestion by ducks on germination, seedling survival, plant growth and asexual multiplication.

Plant biomass and its allocation to vegetative parts (shoot and roots), tubers, and seeds were determined in autumn. More duck-ingested seeds than control (uningested) seeds germinated in early winter, but this difference disappeared for seeds planted in late winter, when the treatments were first stratified for 3 mo. None of the variables for measuring seedling survival and plant performance varied between treatments. Under our experimental conditions (no herbivory or competition), ingestion by ducks in early winter resulted in increased performance for seeds surviving gut passage due to enhanced seed germinability, without other costs or benefits for the seedlings.},

Fruiting phenology was compared among two representative syndromes, such as bird-monkey syndrome (BM) and ruminant-rodent-elephant syndrome (RRE), plus the gravity dispersal species for comparison, in south-western Cameroon in order to examine which biotic or abiotic factors educed syndrome variation. The individual size of selected plants ({\textgreater} 1.6 m in height) was recorded in a 16.95-ha area for recruitment estimation and their fruiting behaviour was checked for 9 months from June 1985 to February 1986. The BM species, a suggested successful group, fruited in a less synchronous manner within species and had fruiting peaks just before and during the rainy season. The RRE species, a suggested failing group, showed greater variation within syndrome in fruiting timing, duration and synchronization. Results obtained supported no clear phenological response to corresponding vertebrates except for the case of Sacoglottis gabonensis in the RRE. The reason for concealing potential responses is probably a result of conflicting requirements for seed dispersal and offspring survival. Periodical fruiting of the BM is likely to reflect ecological constraint, such as water stress on seedlings, caused from syndrome-specific morphological limitation. In this case, the animals have indirect effects on fruiting phenology through selecting syndrome-specific fruit morphology. The greater variation of the RRE suggests a broad spectrum of dispersal tactics from faithful zoochory to alternatives, with a trade off between agent restriction and seed size and another trade off between parental investment and seed-predation risk.},

Offensive tactics include feeding and oviposition choices, enzymatic metabolism of plant compounds, sequestration, morphological adaptations, symbionts, induction of plant galls, and induced plant susceptibility, trenching, and gregarious feeding. We propose that offensive tactics can be categorized usefully depending upon when they are effective and whether they are plastic or fixed traits. The advantages of offensive traits have not been adequately described in terms of herbivore fitness. Similarly, a more complete understanding of the costs and limitations of offensive traits will help put the herbivore back in plant-herbivore interactions and coevolution.},

The natural history of these exploiters is well-described, but relatively little effort has yet been devoted to analysing their ecological or evolutionary significance for mutualism. Exploitation is not a unitary phenomenon, but a set of loosely related phenomena: exploiters may follow mixed strategies or pure strategies at either the species or individual level, may or may not be derived from mutualists, and may or may not inflict significant costs on mutualisms. The evolutionary implications of these different forms of exploitation, especially the threats they pose to the stability of mutualism, have as yet been minimally explored. Studies of this issue are usually framed in terms of a 'temptation to defect' that generates a destabilizing conflict of interest between partners. I argue that this idea is in fact rather inappropriate for interpreting most observed forms of exploitation in mutualisms. I suggest several alternative and testable ideas for how mutualism can persist in the face of exploitation},

abstract = {Similar patterns of dispersal and gene flow between closely associated organisms may promote local adaptation and coevolutionary processes. We compare the genetic structures of the two species of a plant genus (Roridula gorgonias and R. dentata) and their respective obligately associated hemipteran mutualists (Pameridea roridulae and P. marlothi) using allozymes. In addition, we determine whether genetic structure is related to differences in host choice by Pameridea. Allozyme variation was found to be very structured among plant populations but less so among hemipteran populations. Strong genetic structuring among hemipteran populations was only evident when large distances isolated the plant populations on which they live. Although genetic distances among plant populations were correlated with genetic distances among hemipteran populations, genetic distances of both plants and hemipterans were better correlated with geographic distance. Because Roridula and Pameridea have different scales of gene flow, adaptation at the local population level is unlikely. However, the restricted gene flow of both plants and hemipterans could enable adaptation to occur at a regional level. In choice experiments, the hemipteran (Pameridea) has a strong preference for its carnivorous host plant (Roridula) above unrelated host plants. Pameridea also prefers its host species to its closely related sister species. Specialization at the specific level is likely to reinforce cospeciation processes in this mutualism. However, Pameridea does not exhibit intraspecific preferences toward plants from their natal populations above plants from isolated, non-natal populations.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE: In this study, we identified several genes, which potentially contribute to phenological variation in the grapevine. This may help to maintain consistent yield and suitability of particular varieties in future climatic conditions. The timing of major developmental events in fruit crops differs with cultivar, weather conditions and ecological site. This plasticity results also in diverse levels of fruitfulness. Identifying the genetic factors responsible for phenology and fertility variation may help to improve these traits to better match future climates. Two Vitis vinifera populations, an F1 progeny of Syrah × Pinot Noir and a phenological core collection composed of 163 cultivars, were evaluated for phenology and fertility subtraits during three to six growing seasons in the same geographical location. The phenotypic variability in the core collection mostly overlapped with that observed in the F1 progeny and several accessions had exceeding values of phenological response. The progeny population was used together with SSR and SNP markers to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs). This allowed us to detect nine QTLs related to budburst, flowering beginning, the onset of ripening (v{\'{e}}raison) and total fertility, explaining from 8 to 44 {\%} of phenotypic variation. A genomic region on chromosome 15 was associated with budburst and v{\'{e}}raison and two QTLs for fruitfulness were located on chromosomes 3 and 18. Several genes potentially affecting fertility and the timing of fruit development were proposed, based on their position and putative function. Allelic variation at these candidate loci may be explored by sampling accessions from the core collection.},

This view predicts that some tropical trees produce nutritious fruits adapted for use by a small coterie of specialized frugivores that provide reliable seed dissemination. Other tree species are expected to offer superabundant fruits of lower nutritional reward, relying instead on common opportunistic frugivores that are individually less reliable, but collectively disperse seeds effectively. Though widely referenced, many aspects of 'the paradigm' are untested with tropical trees and avian frugivores, primarily because plant ecologists rarely determine whether 'specialist' or 'generalist' foragers are responsible for different patterns of seed distribution, while students of foraging behavior rarely determine the effects seed dispersal by different animals for survival of seeds or seedlings of 'specialist' or 'generalist' trees. Ecological paradigms provide alternative hypotheses, without evolutionary arguments. 'Keystone' species have ecological effects disproportionate to their abundance; it is important for management considerations to know whether fruiting trees or frugivores serve as keystone mutualists in tropical forests. Alternatively, the extent to which vertebrate seed dispersers influence density-dependent seed, seedling, sapling, or adult mortality may have important consequences for spatial dispersion and population dynamics of tree species in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Mutualisms are almost ubiquitously exploited by species that gain the benefits that mutualists offer to each other, but that offer nothing in return. This paper investigates the possible dynamical outcomes of a mechanistically formulated model system, involving two obligate mutualists and one exploiter. The model is based conceptually on a mutualism between a plant species and its pollinating seed parasite in the presence of an obligate, nonpollinating seed parasite. Of particular interest are the conditions under which the exploiter species can invade and coexist with a mutualism that, by itself, possesses an equilibrium stabilized by other density-dependent regulating factors. Two types of models are used in the analyses: a deterministic, nonspatial model described by a set of discrete time equations, and an individual-based simulation incorporating stochastic interactions and spatial structure. Comparing the results of these two models uncovers the temporal dynamics of both well-mixed local systems and spatially distributed populations. Using these two situations, we examine how the predictions of the nonspatial model are affected by habitat structure. In the nonspatial case, and without the exploiters, there are typically two stable equilibria: one having zero densities for both mutualist species, and the other having nonzero densities. This bi-stability is a characteristic feature of obligate mutualisms. When the exploiter species is included, the system always retains the stability of the zero-density equilibrium, but the dynamics of the upper equilibrium can be more complicated, including limit cycle and extinction dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that. spatial structure is a highly stabilizing influence on the three-species system as long as the exploiter's dispersal distance is large relative to the seed dispersal distance of the plant species. Given this condition, the model predicts spatial distributions that are marked by a patchy distribution of plants, with mutualists and exploiters situated about these patches.},

abstract = {Despite its importance to evolutionary theory, convergence remains an understudied phenomenon and is usually investigated using qualitative data. This paper advances a new, multidimensional view of convergence. Three patterns indicative of convergence are discussed, and techniques to discover and test convergent patterns in a quantitative framework are developed. These concepts and methods are applied to a dataset of digitized coordinates on 1554 lizard skulls and 1292 lower jaws to test hypotheses of convergence among herbivorous lizards. Encompassing seven independent acquisitions of herbivory, this lizard sample provides an ideal natural experiment for exploring ideas of convergence among different systems (here, morphological and functional). Three related questions are addressed: (1) Do herbivorous lizards show evidence of convergence in skull and lower jaw morphology? (2) What, if any, is the morphospace pattern associated with this convergence? (3) Is it possible to predict the direction of convergence using functional models? Relative warp analysis and permutation tests reveal that the skulls and lower jaws of herbivorous lizards do show evidence of convergence. Herbivore skulls deviate from their carnivorous or omnivorous sister groups toward the same area of morphospace. Without a phylogenetic perspective, this pattern would not be recognizable. Lower jaws of herbivores are not convergent in morphology but are convergent in function: herbivores deviate away from their carnivorous sister groups toward higher values of mechanical advantage. These results illustrate the desirability of quantitative methods, informed by phylogenetic information, in the study of convergence.},

abstract = {Theory on costs of plant defense against herbivory in stressful environments predicts that costs should increase when competition is intense. This amplifies a fundamental dilemma that plants are thought to face: allocate limited resources to grow fast enough to compete, or invest these resources in secondary metabolites to maintain defense. We studied costs associated with genetic and environmental variation in secondary metabolite production of Brassica rapa in the presence and absence of the generalist competitor Lolium perenne. We used experimental quantitative genetics (artificial selection) to manipulate genetic variation, and herbivore- induction treatments to produce environmental variation in myrosinase and glucosinolate concentrations and resistance. Glucosinolates, and their byproducts after break-down by myrosinase, are known to affect herbivory on plants in the Brassicaceae family. Defense costs were significant in the absence of competitors, but in contrast to theoretical predictions, costs of constitutive defense (measured as growth rates) were not detectable and the cost of induced defense remained the same in the competitive environment. To understand what factors made constitutive defense costs not detectable under competition we conducted several experiments to assess the effects of limited resources and allelopathy on costs and benefits of the defense chemicals. None of the experiments involving nutrient supply and weak competition supported the hypothesis that the lack of defense costs in competitive environments was due to limited resources. Instead, the breakdown products of the glucosinolate-myrosinase reaction appeared to function as allelopathic agents, which may benefit B. rapa plants in competition, thereby reducing net costs of chemical defense. We found that: (1) the effects of exogenous glucosinolates on Lolium root length depended on the presence of myrosinase. (2) In the absence of nutrients, Lolium root lengths were shorter when seeds germinated with B. rapa. (3) Genetic increases in glucosinolate concentration negatively affected Lolium seedling growth only when there were simultaneous genetic increases in myrosinase concentration. Activated carbon treatments designed to neutralize allelopathic effects and restore costs in the competitive environments were, however, not statistically significant. When plant defenses also function to benefit plants in competitive interactions, plants may evolve to compete and defend.},

Despite growing attention in recent years, however, few conceptual themes have yet to be identified that span mutualisms differing in natural history: Here I examine the idea that the ecology and evolution of mutualisms are shaped by diverse costs, not only by the benefits they confer. This concept helps link mutualism to antagonisms such as herbivory, predation, and parasitism, interactions defined largely by the existence of costs. I first briefly review the range of costs associated with mutualisms, then describe how one cost, the consumption of seeds by pollinator offspring, was quantified for one fig/pollinator mutualism. I compare this cost to published values for other fig/pollinator mutualisms and for other kinds of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms, notably the yucca/yucca moth interaction. I then discuss four issues that fundamentally complicate comparative studies of the cost of mutualism: problems of knowing how to measure the magnitude of any one cost accurately; problems associated with using average estimates in the absence of data on sources of variation; complications arising from the complex correlates of costs, such as functional linkages between costs and benefits; and problems that arise from considering the cost of mutualism as a unilateral issue in what is fundamentally a reciprocal interaction. The rich diversity of as-yet unaddressed questions surrounding the costs of mutualism may best be investigated via detailed studies of individual interactions.},

Plots exposed to natural grazing were dominated either by encrusting algae or by red algal turf and articulated corallines. Algae fluctuated in response to El Nino in the following way. During an early phase, crustose Gymnogongrus and/or red algal turf were dominant. In the heart of El Nino, grazers had limited effects on algal cover but influenced algal sizes substantially. Most algae (particularly edible forms) were scarce or declined, although warm-water ephemeral species (notably Giffordia mitchelliae) flourished, increasing diversity and overgrowing crusts. Iguana mortalities were high, and crab densities low. When normal conditions returned, warm-water ephemerals declined, crab densities rose, and grazers had significant but site-specific effects on algae. At one site, any combination of grazers diminished most erect species, reducing diversity and restoring dominance of competitively inferior grazer-resistant crusts. At a second site, only the combined effect of all grazers had this effect. Laboratory experiments confirmed that crabs could control erect algae and promote crustose forms, and crustose Gymnogongrus developed into an erect form in the absence of crabs. Differences between sites and large-scale temporal changes associated with El Nino indicate that tropical shores are not all as constant in time and space as previously suggested. Mobile grazers did affect algal communities, but over the period of our observations far greater effects were attributable to intersite differences and temporal shifts in oceanographic conditions. El Nino events reduce nutrients, intensify wave action, and raise sea levels, affecting food availability for intertidal herbivores and their influence on benthic algae. Thus, the dramatic transformations of communities during El Nino presage the impacts of global climate change.},

We collected fruit and leaf samples, dried them in the field, and analyzed them to measure nutrient content-free simple sugars (FSS), crude protein (CP), lipids, and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC)-and the presence of antifeedants: total tannins, condensed tannins and dietary fiber. We weighted nutrients and antifeedants by timed feeding samples to estimate actual intake. Then we compared intake among months and seasons. Compared with other frugivores, the average monthly intake of lipids was extremely high (16.1{\%} by dry matter estimate(DM)), attributed to ingestion of young seeds and other plant parts that were relatively high in lipids, e.g., seed arils. Intake of FSS and CP were relatively low: 3.4{\%} DM and 6.5{\%} DM, respectively. The average intake of total cell wall or neutral detergent fiber (NDF=38.4{\%} DM) was only slightly lower than the range reported for colobines. Average intake of tannins was within the range reported for cercopithecines: condensed tannins of 3.3{\%} Quebracho units standard (QU). We suggest that white-faced sakis accept a trade-off for food items that are fibrous or astringent if they are also rich in lipids. White-faced sakis expand the typical definition of primate fruit-eater in their high lipid-relatively high NDF-low FSS diet.},

abstract = {The structure of ecological interaction networks is often interpreted as a product of meaningful ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape the degree of specialization in community associations. However, here we show that both unweighted network metrics (connectance, nestedness, and degree distribution) and weighted network metrics (interaction evenness, interaction strength asymmetry) are strongly constrained and biased by the number of observations. Rarely observed species are inevitably regarded as "specialists,'' irrespective of their actual associations, leading to biased estimates of specialization. Consequently, a skewed distribution of species observation records (such as the lognormal), combined with a relatively low sampling density typical for ecological data, already generates a "nested'' and poorly "connected'' network with "asymmetric interaction strengths'' when interactions are neutral. This is confirmed by null model simulations of bipartite networks, assuming that partners associate randomly in the absence of any specialization and any variation in the correspondence of biological traits between associated species (trait matching). Variation in the skewness of the frequency distribution fundamentally changes the outcome of network metrics. Therefore, interpretation of network metrics in terms of fundamental specialization and trait matching requires an appropriate control for such severe constraints imposed by information deficits. When using an alternative approach that controls for these effects, most natural networks of mutualistic or antagonistic systems show a significantly higher degree of reciprocal specialization (exclusiveness) than expected under neutral conditions. A higher exclusiveness is coherent with a tighter coevolution and suggests a lower ecological redundancy than implied by nested networks.},

Among primates and other mammalian groups, measures of host diversification rates vary widely among lineages, but comparative studies have not yet identified a reliable explanation for this variation. In this study, we used a comprehensive data set of disease-causing organisms from free-living primates to illustrate how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to examine mammalian lineage diversity in relation to parasite species richness. Our results provide evidence that the phylogenetic diversity of primate clades is correlated positively with the number of parasite species harbored by each host and that this pattern is largely independent of other host traits that have been shown to influence diversification rates and parasite species richness in primates. We investigated two possible mechanisms that could explain this association, namely that parasites themselves drive host evolutionary diversification through processes linked with sexual selection and that host shifts or host sharing increases parasite species richness among diverse primate clades. Neither parasite species richness nor host diversification is related to measures of sexual selection in primates. Further, we found only partial evidence that more rapidly diversifying host lineages produced increased opportunities for host sharing or host shifting by parasites through mechanisms involving species' geographic range overlap. Thus, our analyses provide evidence for an important link between the evolutionary diversification of primates and the richness of their parasite communities, but other mechanisms, particularly those related to reciprocal selection or coextinction of hosts and parasites, require further investigation.},

abstract = {Ateles spp. and Alouatta spp. are often sympatric, and although they are mainly frugivorous and folivorous, respectively, they consume some of the same fruit species. However, they differ in terms of color vision, which is thought to be important for fruit detection. Alouatta spp. have routine trichromatic color vision, while Ateles spp. presents the classic polymorphism of platyrrhines: heterozygous females have trichromatic color vision, and males and homozygous females have dichromatic vision. Given these perceptual differences, one might expect Alouatta spp. to consume more reddish fruits than Ateles spp., since trichromats have an advantage for detecting fruits of that hue. Furthermore, since Ateles spp. have up to six different color vision phenotypes, as do most other platyrrhines, they might be expected to include fruits with a wider variety of hues in their diet than Alouatta spp. To test these hypotheses we studied the fruit foraging behavior of sympatric Alouatta palliata and Ateles geoffroyi in Costa Rica, and modeled the detectability of fruit via the various color vision phenotypes in these primates. We found little similarity in fruit diet between these two species (Morisita = 0.086). Furthermore, despite its polymorphism, A. geoffroyi consumed more reddish fruits than A. palliata, which consumed more greenish fruits. Our modeling results suggest that most fruit species included in the diet of A. geoffroyi can be discriminated by most color vision phenotypes present in the population. These findings show that the effect of polymorphism in platyrrhines on fruit detection may not be a disadvantage for frugivory. We suggest that routine trichromacy may be advantageous for other foraging tasks, such as feeding on young leaves. Am. J. Primatol. 67:399-409, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The development of fruits after pollination places resource demands on plants that may influence the production of subsequent flowers. Pre-dispersal seed-predation, resulting in the destruction of developing seeds, may allow resource reallocation to the production of subsequent flowers. Silene latifolia, the white campion, is subject to predispersal seed predation by noctuid moths. In order to determine the potential for resource reallocation in S: latifolia we conducted a greenhouse experiment in which female plants were subjected to three levels of pollination (0{\%}, 50{\%}, or 100{\%}) and simulated pre-dispersal seed predation (0{\%}, 50{\%}, or 100{\%} of total fruit production). We assigned 10 plants to each of the seven treatments (0{\%} pollinated had no fruit); in total, 1490 flowers were measured for flower size and scored for date of flowering and longevity. Flower size decreased over the course of the experiment. Average daily production was 12.2 flowers per plant on nonpollinated plants, but only 4.3 flowers on 100{\%} pollinated plants. Chi-square results showed that simulated seed predation resulted in additional flowering bouts later in the course of the experiment. Time series analysis showed that the time between flowering bouts was Also influenced by predation. Plants with 0{\%} predation had an average lag time of 29.5 days, whereas plants with 100{\%} simulated seed predation had a lag period of 20.1 days. Flower longevity of non- pollinated flowers increased in plants that had flowers' pollinated but experienced no seed predation. Simulated predation resulted in a decrease in floral longevity. These results suggest that plants reallocate resources to the production of new flowers, after the destruction of fruits; thus, flowering phenology is influenced by pollination and seed predation. The relationship between pollinators and flowering phenology is well accepted; these. results indicate that seed predators play an equally important role in determining flowering phenology.},

abstract = {Coevolution-reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species-is one of the central biological processes organizing the web of life, and most species are involved in one or more coevolved interactions. We have learned in recent years that coevolution is a highly dynamic process that continually reshapes interactions among species across ecosystems, creating geographic mosaics over timescales sometimes as short as thousands or even hundreds of years. If we take that as our starting point, what should we now be asking about the coevolutionary process? Here I suggest five major questions that we need to answer if we are to understand how coevolution shapes the web of life. How evolutionarily dynamic is specialization to other species, and what is the role of coevolutionary alternation in driving those dynamics? Does the geographic mosaic of coevolution shape adaptation in fundamentally different ways in different forms of interaction? How does the geographic mosaic of coevolution shape speciation? How does the structure of reciprocal selection change during the assembly of large webs of interacting species? How important are genomic events such as whole-genome duplication (i.e., polyploidy) and whole-genome capture (i.e., hybridization) in generating novel webs of interacting species? I end by suggesting four points about coevolution that we should tell every new student or researcher in biology.},

abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

Traditionally, nestedness has been treated in a binary sense: species and their interactions are either present or absent, neglecting information on abundances and interaction frequencies. Extending nestedness to quantitative data facilitates the study of species preferences, and we propose a new detection method that follows from a basic property of bipartite networks: large dominant eigenvalues are associated with highly nested configurations. We show that complex ecological networks are binary nested, but quantitative preferences are non-nested, indicating limited consumer overlap of favoured resources. The spectral graph approach provides a formal link to local dynamical stability analysis, where we demonstrate that nested mutualistic structures are minimally stable. We conclude that, within the binary constraint of interaction plausibility, species preferences are partitioned to avoid competition, thereby benefiting system-wide resource allocation.},

Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure.

Previous works have stressed the importance of these characteristic modes, but neglected the equally important weak modes. Herein a generic system property - interampatteness - is defined that explains the previous feature, and assigns equal weight to the characteristic and weak modes. An interampatte network is characterised by strong INTERactions enabling simultaneous AMPlification and ATTEnuation of different signals. It is postulated that biochemical networks are interampatte, based on published experimental data and theoretical considerations. Existence of multiple time-scales and feedback loops is shown to increase the degree of interampatteness. Interampatteness has strong implications for the dynamics and reverse engineering of the network. One consequence is highly correlated changes in gene expression in response to external perturbations, even in the absence of common transcription factors, implying that interampatte gene regulatory networks erroneously may be assumed to have co-expressed/co-regulated genes. Data compression or reduction of the system dimensionality using clustering, singular value decomposition, principal component analysis or some other data mining technique results in a loss of information that will obstruct reconstruction of the underlying network.

kernel methods for enzyme function prediction. Our focus is in developing
so called structured output prediction methods, where the enzymatic
reaction is the combinatorial target object for prediction. We compared
two structured output prediction methods, the Hierarchical Max-Margin
Markov algorithm (HM3) and the Maximum Margin Regression algorithm
(MMR) in hierarchical classification of enzyme function. As sequence
features we use various string kernels and the GTG feature set derived
from the global alignment trace graph of protein sequences.RESULTS:In
our experiments, in predicting enzyme EC classification we obtain
over 85 accuracy (predicting the four digit EC code) and over 91{\%}
microlabel F1 score (predicting individual EC digits). In predicting
the Gold Standard enzyme families, we obtain over 79{\%} accuracy (predicting
family correctly) and over 89{\%} microlabel F1 score (predicting superfamilies
and families). In the latter case, structured output methods are
significantly more accurate than nearest neighbor classifier. A polynomial
kernel over the GTG feature set turned out to be a prerequisite for
accurate function prediction. Combining GTG with string kernels boosted
accuracy slightly in the case of EC class prediction.CONCLUSION:Structured
output prediction with GTG features is shown to be computationally
feasible and to have accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches
in enzyme function prediction.},

abstract = {Metabolic networks are represented by the set of metabolic pathways. Metabolic pathways are a series of biochemical reactions, in which the product (output) from one reaction serves as the substrate (input) to another reaction. Many pathways remain incompletely characterized. One of the major challenges of computational biology is to obtain better models of metabolic pathways. Existing models are dependent on the annotation of the genes. This propagates error accumulation when the pathways are predicted by incorrectly annotated genes. Pairwise classification methods are supervised learning methods used to classify new pair of entities. Some of these classification methods, e.g., Pairwise Support Vector Machines (SVMs), use pairwise kernels. Pairwise kernels describe similarity measures between two pairs of entities. Using pairwise kernels to handle sequence data requires long processing times and large storage. Rational kernels are kernels based on weighted finite-state transducers that represent similarity measures between sequences or automata. They have been effectively used in problems that handle large amount of sequence information such as protein essentiality, natural language processing and machine translations.$\backslash$nPMID: 25260372},

The aim is to capture the correlations between the scans of an experiment and a set of external predictor variables that are thought to affect the scans, such as type, intensity, or shape of stimulus response. Its main feature is a Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) of the estimated effects of the predictors from a multivariate linear model (MLM). The advantage of this over current methods is that temporal correlations can be incorporated into the model, making the MLM method suitable for fMRI as well as PET data. Moreover, tests for the presence of any correlation, and inference about the number of canonical variates needed to capture that correlation, can be based on standard multivariate statistics, rather than simulations. When applied to an fMRI data set previously analyzed by another CVA method, the MLM method reveals a pattern of responses that is closer to that detected in an earlier non-CVA analysis.},

abstract = {Knowledge on protein folding has a profound impact on understanding the heterogeneity and molecular function of proteins, further facilitating drug design. Predicting the 3D structure (fold) of a protein is a key problem in molecular biology. Determination of the fold of a protein mainly relies on molecular experimental methods. With the development of next-generation sequencing techniques, the discovery of new protein sequences has been rapidly increasing. With such a great number of proteins, the use of experimental techniques to determine protein folding is extremely difficult because these techniques are time consuming and expensive. Thus, developing computational prediction methods that can automatically, rapidly, and accurately classify unknown protein sequences into specific fold categories is urgently needed. Computational recognition of protein folds has been a recent research hotspot in bioinformatics and computational biology. Many computational efforts have been made, generating a variety of computational prediction methods. In this review, we conduct a comprehensive survey of recent computational methods, especially machine learning-based methods, for protein fold recognition. This review is anticipated to assist researchers in their pursuit to systematically understand the computational recognition of protein folds.},

abstract = {How many dimensions (trait-axes) are required to predict whether two species interact? This unanswered question originated with the idea of ecological niches, and yet bears relevance today for understanding what determines network structure. Here, we analyse a set of 200 ecological networks, including food webs, antagonistic and mutualistic networks, and find that the number of dimensions needed to completely explain all interactions is small ( {\textless} 10), with model selection favouring less than five. Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations. These results link ecologically important species attributes to large-scale community structure.},

These parameters can be explored using text search, advanced search, substructure and similarity-based analysis tools that are embedded in SMMRNA. A structure editor is provided for 3D visualization of ligands. Advance analysis can be performed using substructure and OpenBabel-based chemical similarity fingerprints. Upload facility for both RNA and ligands is also provided. The physicochemical properties of the ligands were further examined using OpenBabel descriptors, hierarchical clustering, binning partition and multidimensional scaling. We have also generated a 3D conformation database of ligands to support the structure and ligand-based screening. SMMRNA provides comprehensive resource for further design, development and refinement of small molecule modulators for selective targeting of RNA molecules.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the "LINE," which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online.},

@article{Frund2015,
abstract = {Network approaches have become a popular tool for understanding ecological complexity in a changing world. Many network descriptors relate directly or indirectly to specialization, which is a central concept in ecology and measured in different ways. Unfortunately, quantification of specialization and network structure using field data can suffer from sampling effects. Previous studies evaluating such sampling effects either used field data where the true network structure is unknown, or they simulated sampling based on completely generalized interactions. Here, we used a quantitative niche model to generate bipartite networks representing a wide range of specialization and evaluated potential sampling biases for a large set of specialization and network metrics for different network sizes. We show that with sample sizes realistic for species-rich networks, all metrics are biased towards overestimating specialization (and underestimating generalization and niche overlap). Importantly, this sampling bias depends on the true degree of specialization and is strongest for generalized networks. As a result, null models simulating generalized interactions may misrepresent sampling bias. We show that other methods used for empirical data may be biased in the opposite direction and strongly overestimate sampling completeness. Some network metrics are barely related between small and large sub-samples of the same network and thus may often not be meaningful. Small samples also overestimate interspecific variation of specialization within generalized networks. While new approaches to deal with these challenges have to be developed, we also identify metrics that are relatively unbiased and fairly consistent across sampling intensities and we identify a provisional rule of thumb for the number of observations required for accurate estimates. Our quantitative niche model can help understand variation in network structure capturing both sampling effects and biological meaning. This is needed to connect network science to fundamental ecological theory and to give robust quantitative answers for applied ecological problems. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {A calculation of the binding free energy for the dimerization of insulin has been performed using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area approach. The calculated absolute binding free energy is -11.9 kcal/mol, in approximate agreement with the experimental value of -7.2 kcal/mol. The results show that the dimerization is mainly due to nonpolar interactions. The role of the hydrogen bonds between the 2 monomers appears to give the direction of the interactions. A per-atom decomposition of the binding free energy has been performed to identify the residues contributing most to the self association free energy. Residues B24-B26 are found to make the largest favorable contributions to the dimerization. Other residues situated at the interface between the 2 monomers were found to make favorable but smaller contributions to the dimerization: Tyr B16, Val B12, and Pro B28, and to an even lesser extent, Gly B23. The energy decomposition on a per-residue basis is in agreement with experimental alanine scanning data. The results obtained from a single trajectory (i.e., the dimer trajectory is also used for the monomer analysis) and 2 trajectories (i.e., separate trajectories are used for the monomer and dimer) are similar.},

Here, the concept of graph alignment as a novel method for the structural analysis of protein binding pockets is presented. Using inexact graph-matching techniques, one is able to identify both conserved areas and regions of difference among different binding pockets. Thus, using multiple graph alignments, it is possible to characterize functional protein families and to examine differences among related protein families independent of sequence or fold homology. Optimized algorithms are described for the efficient calculation of multiple graph alignments for the analysis of physicochemical descriptors representing protein binding pockets. Additionally, it is shown how the calculated graph alignments can be analyzed to identify structural features that are characteristic for a given protein family and also features that are discriminative among related families. The methods are applied to a substantial high-quality subset of the PDB database and their ability to successfully characterize and classify 10 highly populated functional protein families is shown. Additionally, two related protein families from the group of serine proteases are examined and important structural differences are detected automatically and efficiently.},

abstract = {Genomic centers discover increasingly many protein sequences and structures, but not necessarily their full biological functions. Thus, currently, less than one percent of proteins have experimentally verified biochemical activities. To fill this gap, function prediction algorithms apply metrics of similarity between proteins on the premise that those sufficiently alike in sequence, or structure, will perform identical functions. Although high sensitivity is elusive, network analyses that integrate these metrics together hold the promise of rapid gains in function prediction specificity.},

abstract = {Cooperation between organisms of different species is a widely observed phenomenon in biology, ranging from large scale systems such as whole ecosystems to more direct interactions like symbiotic relationships. In the present work, we explore inter-species cooperations on the level of metabolic networks. For our analysis, we extract 447 organism specific metabolic networks from the KEGG database [7] and assess their biosynthetic capabilities by applying the method of network expansion [5]. We simulate the cooperation of two organisms by unifying their metabolic networks and introduce a measure, the gain Gamma, quantifying the amount by which the biosynthetic capability of an organism is enhanced due to the cooperation with another species. For all theoretically possible pairs of organisms, this synergetic effect is determined and we systematically analyze its dependency on the dissimilarities of the interacting partners. We describe these dissimilarities by two different distance measures, where one is based on structural, the other on evolutionary differences. With the presented method, we provide a conceptional framework to study the metabolic effects resulting from an interaction of different species. We outline possible enhancements of our analysis: by defining more realistic interacting networks and applying alternative structural investigation methods, our concept can be used to study specific symbiotic and parasitic relationships and may help to understand the global interplay of metabolic pathways over the boundary of organism specific systems.},

abstract = {Inferring biotic interactions from functional, phylogenetic and geographical proxies remains one great challenge in ecology. We propose a conceptual framework to infer the backbone of biotic interaction networks within regional species pools. First, interacting groups are identified to order links and remove forbidden interactions between species. Second, additional links are removed by examination of the geographical context in which species co-occur. Third, hypotheses are proposed to establish interaction probabilities between species. We illustrate the framework using published food-webs in terrestrial and marine systems. We conclude that preliminary descriptions of the web of life can be made by careful integration of data with theory.},

@article{Missiuro2009,
abstract = {Recent studies of cellular networks have revealed modular organizations of genes and proteins. For example, in interactome networks, a module refers to a group of interacting proteins that form molecular complexes and/or biochemical pathways and together mediate a biological process. However, it is still poorly understood how biological information is transmitted between different modules. We have developed information flow analysis, a new computational approach that identifies proteins central to the transmission of biological information throughout the network. In the information flow analysis, we represent an interactome network as an electrical circuit, where interactions are modeled as resistors and proteins as interconnecting junctions. Construing the propagation of biological signals as flow of electrical current, our method calculates an information flow score for every protein. Unlike previous metrics of network centrality such as degree or betweenness that only consider topological features, our approach incorporates confidence scores of protein-protein interactions and automatically considers all possible paths in a network when evaluating the importance of each protein. We apply our method to the interactome networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that the likelihood of observing lethality and pleiotropy when a protein is eliminated is positively correlated with the protein's information flow score. Even among proteins of low degree or low betweenness, high information scores serve as a strong predictor of loss-of-function lethality or pleiotropy. The correlation between information flow scores and phenotypes supports our hypothesis that the proteins of high information flow reside in central positions in interactome networks. We also show that the ranks of information flow scores are more consistent than that of betweenness when a large amount of noisy data is added to an interactome. Finally, we combine gene expression data with interaction data in C. elegans and construct an interactome network for muscle-specific genes. We find that genes that rank high in terms of information flow in the muscle interactome network but not in the entire network tend to play important roles in muscle function. This framework for studying tissue-specific networks by the information flow model can be applied to other tissues and other organisms as well.},

abstract = {Exome sequencing provides unprecedented insights into cancer biology and pharmacological response. Here we assess these two parameters for the NCI-60, which is among the richest genomic and pharmacological publicly available cancer cell line databases. Homozygous genetic variants that putatively affect protein function were identified in 1,199 genes (approximately 6{\%} of all genes). Variants that are either enriched or depleted compared to non-cancerous genomes, and thus may be influential in cancer progression and differential drug response were identified for 2,546 genes. Potential gene knockouts are made available. Assessment of cell line response to 19,940 compounds, including 110 FDA-approved drugs, reveals ≈80-fold range in resistance versus sensitivity response across cell lines. 103,422 gene variants were significantly correlated with at least one compound (at p{\textless}0.0002). These include genes of known pharmacological importance such as IGF1R, BRAF, RAD52, MTOR, STAT2 and TSC2 as well as a large number of candidate genes such as NOM1, TLL2, and XDH. We introduce two new web-based CellMiner applications that enable exploration of variant-to-compound relationships for a broad range of researchers, especially those without bioinformatics support. The first tool, "Genetic variant versus drug visualization", provides a visualization of significant correlations between drug activity-gene variant combinations. Examples are given for the known vemurafenib-BRAF, and novel ifosfamide-RAD52 pairings. The second, "Genetic variant summation" allows an assessment of cumulative genetic variations for up to 150 combined genes together; and is designed to identify the variant burden for molecular pathways or functional grouping of genes. An example of its use is provided for the EGFR-ERBB2 pathway gene variant data and the identification of correlated EGFR, ERBB2, MTOR, BRAF, MEK and ERK inhibitors. The new tools are implemented as an updated web-based CellMiner version, for which the present publication serves as a compendium.},

abstract = {The recent growth in protein databases has revealed the functional diversity of many protein superfamilies. We have assessed the functional variation of homologous enzyme superfamilies containing two or more enzymes, as defined by the CATH protein structure classification, by way of the Enzyme Commission (EC) scheme. Combining sequence and structure information to identify relatives, the majority of superfamilies display variation in enzyme function, with 25 {\%} of superfamilies in the PDB having members of different enzyme types. We determined the extent of functional similarity at different levels of sequence identity for 486,000 homologous pairs (enzyme/enzyme and enzyme/non-enzyme), with structural and sequence relatives included. For single and multi-domain proteins, variation in EC number is rare above 40 {\%} sequence identity, and above 30 {\%}, the first three digits may be predicted with an accuracy of at least 90 {\%}. For more distantly related proteins sharing less than 30 {\%} sequence identity, functional variation is significant, and below this threshold, structural data are essential for understanding the molecular basis of observed functional differences. To explore the mechanisms for generating functional diversity during evolution, we have studied in detail 31 diverse structural enzyme superfamilies for which structural data are available. A large number of variations and peculiarities are observed, at the atomic level through to gross structural rearrangements. Almost all superfamilies exhibit functional diversity generated by local sequence variation and domain shuffling. Commonly, substrate specificity is diverse across a superfamily, whilst the reaction chemistry is maintained. In many superfamilies, the position of catalytic residues may vary despite playing equivalent functional roles in related proteins. The implications of functional diversity within supefamilies for the structural genomics projects are discussed. More detailed information on these superfamilies is available at http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/FAM-EC/.},

abstract = {Regularization is an approach to function learning that balances fit and smoothness. In practice, we search for a function f with a finite representation f = {\&}931; i c i {\&}966; i ({\&}183;). In most treatments, the c i are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization , constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas. In summary, the combination of value regularization and Fenchel duality are valuable tools for studying the optimization problems in machine learning.},

The self-constructed and commercial platforms established in the last few years, employ non-destructive methods and measurements on a large and high-throughput scale. The platforms offer to certain extent, automated measurements, using either simple single sensor analysis, or advanced integrative simultaneous analysis by multiple sensors. However, due to the complexity of the approaches used, it is not always clear what such forms of plant phenotyping can offer the potential end-user, i.e. plant biologist. This review focuses on imaging methods used in the phenotyping of plant shoots including a brief survey of the sensors used. To open up this topic to a broader audience, we provide here a simple introduction to the principles of automated non-destructive analysis, namely RGB, chlorophyll fluorescence, thermal and hyperspectral imaging. We further on present an overview on how and to which extent, the automated integrative in-house phenotyping platforms have been used recently to study the responses of plants to various changing environments.},

abstract = {Abstract Across different taxa, networks of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions show consistent architecture. Most networks are modular, with modules being distinct species subsets connected mainly with each other and having few connections to other modules. We investigate the phylogenetic relatedness of species within modules and whether a phylogenetic signal is detectable in the within- and among-module connectivity of species using 27 mammal-flea networks from the Palaearctic. In the 24 networks that were modular, closely related hosts co-occurred in the same module more often than expected by chance; in contrast, this was rarely the case for parasites. The within- and among-module connectivity of the same host or parasite species varied geographically. However, among-module but not within-module connectivity of host and parasites was somewhat phylogenetically constrained. These findings suggest that the establishment of host-parasite networks results from the interplay between phylogenetic influences acting mostly on hosts and local factors acting on parasites, to create an asymmetrically constrained pattern of geographic variation in modular structure. Modularity in host-parasite networks seems to result from the shared evolutionary history of hosts and by trait convergence among unrelated parasites. This suggests profound differences between hosts and parasites in the establishment and functioning of bipartite antagonistic networks.},

abstract = {Background: Recently, supervised learning methods have been exploited to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. The reconstruction of a network is modeled as a binary classification problem for each pair of genes. A statistical classifier is trained to recognize the relationships between the activation profiles of gene pairs. This approach has been proven to outperform previous unsupervised methods. However, the supervised approach raises open questions. In particular, although known regulatory connections can safely be assumed to be positive training examples, obtaining negative examples is not straightforward, because definite knowledge is typically not available that a given pair of genes do not interact. Results: A recent advance in research on data mining is a method capable of learning a classifier from only positive and unlabeled examples, that does not need labeled negative examples. Applied to the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, we show that this method significantly outperforms the current state of the art of machine learning methods. We assess the new method using both simulated and experimental data, and obtain major performance improvement.},

abstract = {Signaling networks that convert graded stimuli into binary, all-or-none cellular responses are critical in processes ranging from cell-cycle control to lineage commitment. To exhaustively enumerate topologies that exhibit this switch-like behavior, we simulated all possible two- and three-component networks on random parameter sets, and assessed the resulting response profiles for both steepness (ultrasensitivity) and extent of memory (bistability). Simulations were used to study purely enzymatic networks, purely transcriptional networks, and hybrid enzymatic/transcriptional networks, and the topologies in each class were rank ordered by parametric robustness (i.e., the percentage of applied parameter sets exhibiting ultrasensitivity or bistability). Results reveal that the distribution of network robustness is highly skewed, with the most robust topologies clustering into a small number of motifs. Hybrid networks are the most robust in generating ultrasensitivity (up to 28{\%}) and bistability (up to 18{\%}); strikingly, a purely transcriptional framework is the most fragile in generating either ultrasensitive (up to 3{\%}) or bistable (up to 1{\%}) responses. The disparity in robustness among the network classes is due in part to zero-order ultrasensitivity, an enzyme-specific phenomenon, which repeatedly emerges as a particularly robust mechanism for generating nonlinearity and can act as a building block for switch-like responses. We also highlight experimentally studied examples of topologies enabling switching behavior, in both native and synthetic systems, that rank highly in our simulations. This unbiased approach for identifying topologies capable of a given response may be useful in discovering new natural motifs and in designing robust synthetic gene networks.},

abstract = {Genomics has revolutionized biology, enabling the interrogation of whole transcriptomes, genome-wide binding sites for proteins, and many other molecular processes. However, individual genomic assays measure elements that interact in vivo as components of larger molecular machines. Understanding how these high-order interactions drive gene expression presents a substantial statistical challenge. Building on Random Forests (RF), Random Intersection Trees (RITs), and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we developed the iterative Random Forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with same order of computational cost as RF. We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20 pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80{\%} have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, novel third-order interactions, e.g. between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF re-discovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation, and identified novel 5th and 6th order interactions, indicative of multi-valent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation. By decoupling the order of interactions from the computational cost of identification, iRF opens new avenues of inquiry into the molecular mechanisms underlying genome biology.},

The paper proposes a generalized and flexible graph CNN taking data of arbitrary graph structure as input. In that way a task-driven adaptive graph is learned for each graph data while training.

Extensive experiments on nine graph-structured datasets have demonstrated the superior performance improvement on both convergence speed and predictive accuracy.},

@article{Gillis2012a,
abstract = {Gene networks are commonly interpreted as encoding functional information in their connections. An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share function. Guilt by association provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the network. In effect, the apparent encoding of function within networks has been largely driven by outliers whose behaviour cannot even be generalized to individual genes, let alone to the network at large. While experimentalist-driven analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale computational analyses have typically assumed that high-performance cross-validation in a network is due to a generalizable encoding of function. Because we find that gene function is not systemically encoded in networks, but dependent on specific and critical interactions, we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks encode function and what information computational analyses use to extract functional meaning. We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as scale-free-like behaviour, do not map onto the functional connectivity within networks.},

abstract = {Experimental determination of drug-target interactions is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a continuous demand for more accurate predictions of interactions using computational techniques. Algorithms have been devised to infer novel interactions on a global scale where the input to these algorithms is a drug-target network (i.e., a bipartite graph where edges connect pairs of drugs and targets that are known to interact). However, these algorithms had difficulty predicting interactions involving new drugs or targets for which there are no known interactions (i.e., "orphan" nodes in the network). Since data usually lie on or near to low-dimensional non-linear manifolds, we propose two matrix factorization methods that use graph regularization in order to learn such manifolds. In addition, considering that many of the non-occurring edges in the network are actually unknown or missing cases, we developed a preprocessing step to enhance predictions in the "new drug" and "new target" cases by adding edges with intermediate interaction likelihood scores. In our cross validation experiments, our methods achieved better results than three other state-of-the-art methods in most cases. Finally, we simulated some "new drug" and "new target" cases and found that GRMF predicted the left-out interactions reasonably well.},

DG, 0000-0002-4498-7076; WT, 0000-0002-5388-5274 There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to charac-terize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem function-ing was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understand-ing of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

abstract = {The analysis of mutualistic networks has become a central tool in answering theoretical and applied questions regarding our understanding of ecological processes. Significant gaps in knowledge do however need to be bridged in order to effectively and accurately be able to describe networks. Main concern are the incorporation of species level information, accounting for sampling limitations and understanding linkage rules. Here I propose a simple method to combine plant pollinator effort-limited sampling with information about plant community to gain understanding of what drives linkage rules, while accounting for possible undetected linkages. I use hierarchical models to estimate the probability of detection of each plant-pollinator interaction in 12 Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. As it is possible to incorporate plant traits as co-variables in the models, this method has the potential to be used for predictive purposes, such as identifying undetected links among existing species, as well as potential interactions with new plant species. Results show that pollinator detectability is very skewed and usually low. Nevertheless, 84{\%} of the models are enhanced by the inclusion of co-variables, with flower abundance and inflorescence type being the most commonly retained co-variables. The predicted networks increase network Connectance by 13{\%}, but not Nestedness, which is known to be robust to sampling effects. However, 46{\%} of the pollinator interactions in the studied networks comprised a single observation and hence could not be modeled. The hierarchical modeling approach suggested here is highly flexible and can be used on binary or frequency networks, accommodate different observers or include collection day weather variables as confounding factors. An R script is provided for a rapid adoption of this method.},

Ecological interactions and their interactive intensity may be detected by sampling biological taxa in the field and by detecting various between-taxa distances or similarities. Network may clearly exhibit the complex interactions among biological taxa. Statistic tests on various distance or similarity measures and computer designs are required to infer the {\{}network. We develop an algorithm and software to infer the network of direct or indirect ecological interactions in ecosystem. It is a prompt and effective tool in monitoring and assessment of the environment. A redundant network may be inferred and drawn by computer based on the statistic tests on sampling data or the pathway information given in HTML file. Dominant taxa may be found in the network. In total of 16 distance and similarity measures, including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Pearson correlation, partial correlation, point correlation, linkage coefficients, Jaccard coefficient etc., are provided to detect taxa pairs with significant parametric or nonparametric similarities, based on randomization tests and ordinary statistic tests. Criteria to use distance and similarity measures are discussed.}},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in modelling microbial growth as an alternative to time-consuming, traditional, microbiological enumeration techniques. Several statistical models have been reported to describe the growth of different microorganisms, but there are accuracy problems. An alternate technique 'artificial neural networks' (ANN) for modelling microbial growth is explained and evaluated. Published data were used to build separate general regression neural network (GRNN) structures for modelling growth of Aeromonas hydrophila, Shigella flexneri, and Brochothrix thermosphacta. Both GRNN and published statistical model predictions were compared against the experimental data using six statistical indices. For training data sets, the GRNN predictions were far superior than the statistical model predictions, whereas the GRNN predictions were similar or slightly worse than statistical model predictions for test data sets for all the three data sets. GRNN predictions can be considered good, considering its performance for unseen data. Graphical plots, mean relative percentage residual, mean absolute relative residual, and root mean squared residual were identified as suitable indices for comparing competing models. ANN can now become a vehicle whereby predictive microbiology can be applied in food product development and food safety risk assessment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

@article{Adams,
abstract = {Many important problems are characterized by the eigenvalues of a large matrix. For example, the difficulty of many optimization problems, such as those arising from the fitting of large models in statistics and machine learning, can be investigated via the spectrum of the Hessian of the empirical loss function. Network data can be understood via the eigenstructure of a graph Laplacian matrix using spectral graph theory. Quantum simulations and other many-body problems are often characterized via the eigenvalues of the solution space, as are various dynamic systems. However, nave eigenvalue estimation is computationally expensive even when the matrix can be represented; in many of these situations the matrix is so large as to only be available implicitly via products with vectors. Even worse, one may only have noisy estimates of such matrix vector products. In this work, we combine several different techniques for randomized estimation and show that it is possible to construct unbiased estimators to answer a broad class of questions about the spectra of such implicit matrices, even in the presence of noise. We validate these methods on large-scale problems in which graph theory and random matrix theory provide ground truth.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: As more genomic data becomes available there is increased attention on understanding the mechanisms encoded in the genome. New XML dialects like CellML and Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) are being developed to describe biological networks of all types. In the absence of detailed kinetic information for these networks, stoichiometric data is an especially valuable source of information. Network databases are the next logical step beyond storing purely genomic information. Just as comparison of entries in genomic databases has been a vital algorithmic problem through the course of the sequencing project, comparison of networks in network databases will be a crucial problem as we seek to integrate higher-order network knowledge. RESULTS: We show that comparing the stoichiometric structure of two reactions systems is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem. This is encouraging because graph isomorphism is, in practice, a tractable problem using heuristics. The analogous problem of searching for a subsystem of a reaction system is NP-complete. We also discuss heuristic issues in implementations for practical comparison of stoichiometric matrices.},

abstract = {Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.},

abstract = {Two foundational questions about sustainability are “How are ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?” and “How do human decisions affect these trajectories?” Answering these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes. Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.},

abstract = {Proteochemometrics is a new methodology that allows prediction of protein function directly from real interaction measurement data without the need of 3D structure information. Several reported proteochemometric models of ligand-receptor interactions have already yielded significant insights into various forms of bio-molecular interactions. The proteochemometric models are multivariate regression models that predict binding affinity for a particular combination of features of the ligand and protein. Although proteochemometric models have already offered interesting results in various studies, no detailed statistical evaluation of their average predictive power has been performed. In particular, variable subset selection performed to date has always relied on using all available examples, a situation also encountered in microarray gene expression data analysis.},

@article{Bradford2010,
abstract = {Despite recent advances, accurate gene function prediction remains an elusive goal, with very few methods directly applicable to the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we present GO-At (gene ontology prediction in A. thaliana), a method that combines five data types (co-expression, sequence, phylogenetic profile, interaction and gene neighbourhood) to predict gene function in Arabidopsis. Using a simple, yet powerful two-step approach, GO-At first generates a list of genes ranked in descending order of probability of functional association with the query gene. Next, a prediction score is automatically assigned to each function in this list based on the assumption that functions appearing most frequently at the top of the list are most likely to represent the function of the query gene. In this way, the second step provides an effective alternative to simply taking the 'best hit' from the first list, and achieves success rates of up to 79{\%}. GO-At is applicable across all three GO categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component, and can assign functions at multiple levels of annotation detail. Furthermore, we demonstrate GO-At's ability to predict functions of uncharacterized genes by identifying ten putative golgins/Golgi-associated proteins amongst 8219 genes of previously unknown cellular component and present independent evidence to support our predictions. A web-based implementation of GO-At (http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/goat) is available, providing a unique resource for plant researchers to make predictions for uncharacterized genes and predict novel functions in Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {Given sufficient large protein families, and using a global statistical inference approach, it is possible to obtain sufficient accuracy in protein residue contact predictions to predict the structure of many proteins. However, these approaches do not consider the fact that the contacts in a protein are neither randomly, nor independently distributed, but actually follow precise rules governed by the structure of the protein and thus are interdependent. Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for $\beta$-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs. The improved contact prediction enables improved structure prediction.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sequence similarity often suggests evolutionary relationships between protein sequences that can be important for inferring similarity of structure or function. The most widely-used pairwise sequence comparison algorithms for homology detection, such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST, often fail to detect less conserved remotely-related targets. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a new general graph-based propagation algorithm called MotifProp to detect more subtle similarity relationships than pairwise comparison methods. MotifProp is based on a protein-motif network, in which edges connect proteins and the k-mer based motif features that they contain. We show that our new motif-based propagation algorithm can improve the ranking results over a base algorithm, such as PSI-BLAST, that is used to initialize the ranking. Despite the complex structure of the protein-motif network, MotifProp can be easily interpreted using the top-ranked motifs and motif-rich regions induced by the propagation, both of which are helpful for discovering conserved structural components in remote homologies.},

Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47{\%} of attempts to replicate OpenDrop were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications.

We generated the SOMs for tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies in 10- and 100-kb sequence fragments from 38 eukaryotes for which almost complete genome sequences are available. SOM recognized species-specific characteristics (key combinations of oligonucleotide frequencies) in the genomic sequences, permitting species-specific classification of the sequences without any information regarding the species. We also generated the SOM for tetranucleotide frequencies in 1-kb sequence fragments from the human genome and found sequences for four functional categories (5' and 3' UTRs, CDSs and introns) were classified primarily according to the categories. Because the classification and visualization power is very high, SOM is an efficient and powerful tool for extracting a wide range of genome information.},

abstract = {1. Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term ‘interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchange- able with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator–prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non- trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

abstract = {The EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers represent a hierarchical classification of enzymatic reactions, but they are also commonly utilized as identifiers of enzymes or enzyme genes in the analysis of complete genomes. This duality of the EC numbers makes it possible to link the genomic repertoire of enzyme genes to the chemical repertoire of metabolic pathways, the process called metabolic reconstruction. Unfortunately, there are numerous reactions known to be present in various pathways, but they will never get EC numbers because the EC number assignment requires published articles on full characterization of enzymes. Here we report a computerized method to automatically assign the EC numbers up to the sub-subclasses, i.e., without the fourth serial number for substrate specificity, given pairs of substrates and products. The method is based on a new classification scheme of enzymatic reactions, named the RC (reaction classification) number. Each reaction in the current dataset of the EC numbers is first decomposed into reactant pairs. Each pair is then structurally aligned to identify the reaction center, the matched region, and the difference region. The RC number represents the conversion patterns of atom types in these three regions. We examined the correspondence between computationally assigned RC numbers and manually assigned EC numbers by the jackknife cross-validation test and found that the EC sub-subclasses could be assigned with the accuracy of about 90{\%}. Furthermore, we examined the correlation with genomic information as represented by the KEGG ortholog clusters (OC) and confirmed that the RC numbers are correlated not only with elementary reaction mechanisms but also with protein families.},

Over the past 40 years, the timescales that can be simulated by atomistic MD are doubling every 1.3 years - which is faster than Moore's law. Thus, these advances are not simply due to the availability of faster computers.

abstract = {* Biotic interactions do not occur in isolation but are imbedded in a network of species interactions. Network analysis facilitates the compilation and understanding of the complexity found in natural ecosystems and is a powerful tool to reveal information on the degree of specialization of the interacting partners and their niches. The indices measuring these properties are based on qualitative or quantitative observations of interactions between partners from different trophic levels, which informs about the structure of network patterns, but not about the underlying mechanisms. Functional traits may control the interaction strength between partners and also the (micro-) structure of networks. Here, we ask whether flower visitors specialize on certain plant traits and how this trait specialization contributes to niche partitioning and interaction partner diversity. * We introduce two novel statistical approaches suited to evaluate the dimension of the realized niche and to analyse which traits determine niches. As basis for our analysis, we measured 10 quantitative flower traits and evaluated whether 31 arthropod taxa i visited flowers displaying only subsets of the available trait characteristics, indicating a specialization on these traits by narrow trait-widths 〈Si〉. The product of 10 trait- and species-specific trait-widths 〈Si〉 was defined as trait-volume Vi (expansion of a n-dimensional hypervolume) occupied by each taxon i. These indices are applicable beyond flower–visitor interactions to quantify realized niches based on various biotic and abiotic factors. * Each flower visitor species showed some degree of specialization to a unique set of flower traits (realized niche). Overall, our data suggested a hierarchical sequence of flower traits influencing the flower visitors' behaviour and thus network structure: flowering phenology was found to have the strongest effect, followed by flower height, nectar-tube depth and floral reflectance. Less important were pollen-mass/flower, sugar/flower, anther position, phylogeny, display size and abundance. * The species-specific specialization on traits suggests that plant communities with more diverse floral niches may sustain a larger number of flower visitors with non-redundant fundamental niches. Our study and statistical approach provide a basis for a better understanding of how plant traits shape interactions between flowers and their visitors and thus network structure.},

A critical comparison between different protein production systems, as provided in this review, can aid in assessing the potentials and pitfalls of applying systems biotechnology concepts to heterologous protein producing yeasts. Apart from modelling, the methodological basis of systems biology strongly relies on postgenomic methods.

abstract = {Motivation: Supervised machine learning techniques have traditionally been very successful at reconstructing biological networks, such as protein-ligand interaction, protein-protein interaction and gene regulatory networks. Recently, much emphasis has been placed on the correct evaluation of such supervised models. It is vital to distinguish between using the model to either predict new interactions in a given network or to predict interactions for a new vertex not present in the original network. Specific cross-validation schemes need to be used to assess the performance in such different prediction settings. Results: We present a series of leave-one-out cross-validation shortcuts to rapidly estimate the performance of state-of-the-art kernel-based network inference techniques. Availability: The machine learning techniques with the algebraic shortcuts are implemented in the RLScore software package.},

abstract = {Methods for predicting protein function from structure are becoming more important as the rate at which structures are solved increases more rapidly than experimental knowledge. As a result, protein structures now frequently lack functional annotations. The majority of methods for predicting protein function are reliant upon identifying a similar protein and transferring its annotations to the query protein. This method fails when a similar protein cannot be identified, or when any similar proteins identified also lack reliable annotations. Here, we describe a method that can assign function from structure without the use of algorithms reliant upon alignments. Using simple attributes that can be calculated from any crystal structure, such as secondary structure content, amino acid propensities, surface properties and ligands, we describe each enzyme in a non-redundant set. The set is split according to Enzyme Classification (EC) number. We combine the predictions of one-class versus one-class support vector machine models to make overall assignments of EC number to an accuracy of 35{\%} with the top-ranked prediction, rising to 60{\%} accuracy with the top two ranks. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of simple structural attributes in protein function prediction and shed light on the link between structure and function. We apply our methods to predict the function of every currently unclassified protein in the Protein Data Bank.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that numerical modelling and computer simulations can be used as a powerful research tool to understand, and sometimes to predict, the tendencies and peculiarities in the dynamics of populations and ecosystems. It has been, however, much less appreciated that the context of modelling and simulations in ecology is essentially differ-ent from those that normally exist in other natural sciences. In our paper, we review the computational challenges arising in modern ecology in the spirit of computational mathemat-ics, i.e. with our main focus on the choice and use of adequate numerical methods. Somewhat paradoxically, the complexity of ecological problems does not always require the use of com-plex computational methods. This paradox, however, can be easily resolved if we recall that application of sophisticated computational methods usually requires clear and unambiguous mathematical problem statement as well as clearly defined benchmark information for model validation. At the same time, many ecological problems still do not have mathematically accurate and unambiguous description, and available field data are often very noisy, and hence it can be hard to understand how the results of computations should be interpreted from the ecological viewpoint. In this scientific context, computational ecology has to deal with a new paradigm: conventional issues of numerical modelling such as convergence and stability become less important than the qualitative analysis that can be provided with the help of computational techniques. We discuss this paradigm by considering computational challenges arising in several specific ecological applications.},

@article{Bock2005,
abstract = {This paper describes a virtual screening methodology that generates a ranked list of high-binding small molecule ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors (oGPCRs), circumventing the requirement for receptor three-dimensional structure determination. Features representing the receptor are based only on physicochemical properties of primary amino acid sequence, and ligand features use the two-dimensional atomic connection topology and atomic properties. An experimental screen comprised nearly 2 million hypothetical oGPCR-ligand complexes, from which it was observed that the top 1.96{\%} predicted affinity scores corresponded to "highly active" ligands against orphan receptors. Results representing predicted high-scoring novel ligands for many oGPCRs are presented here. Validation of the method was carried out in several ways: (1) A random permutation of the structure-activity relationship of the training data was carried out; by comparing test statistic values of the randomized and nonshuffled data, we conclude that the value obtained with nonshuffled data is unlikely to have been encountered by chance. (2) Biological activities linked to the compounds with high cross-target binding affinity were analyzed using computed log-odds from a structure-based program. This information was correlated with literature citations where GPCR-related pathways or processes were linked to the bioactivity in question. (3) Anecdotal, out-of-sample predictions for nicotinic targets and known ligands were performed, with good accuracy in the low-to-high "active" binding range. (4) An out-of-sample consistency check using the commercial antipsychotic drug olanzapine produced "active" to "highly-active" predicted affinities for all oGPCRs in our study, an observation that is consistent with documented findings of cross-target affinity of this compound for many different GPCRs. It is suggested that this virtual screening approach may be used in support of the functional characterization of oGPCRs by identifying potential cognate ligands. Ultimately, this approach may have implications for pharmaceutical therapies to modulate the activity of faulty or disease-related cellular signaling pathways. In addition to application to cell surface receptors, this approach is a generalized strategy for discovery of small molecules that may bind intracellular enzymes and involve protein-protein interactions.},

Filtering by gene expression data increased accuracy further for the few, most reliably predicted interactions (low recall).

abstract = {Topological food webs illustrating ‘‘who eats whom'' in different systems exhibit similar, non-random, structures suggesting that general rules govern food web structure. Current food web models correctly predict many measures of food web topology from knowledge of species richness and connectance (fraction of po- ssible predatorprey links that actually occur), together with assumptions about the ecological rules governing ‘‘who eats whom''. However, current measures are relatively insensitive to small changes in topology. Improvement of, and discrimination among, current models requires development of new measures of food web structure. Here I examine whether current food web models (cascade, niche, and nested hierarchy models, plus a random null model) can predict a new measure of food web structure, structural stability. Structural stability complements other measures of food web topology because it is sensitive to changes in topology that other measures often miss. The cascade and null models respectively over- and underpredict structural stability for a set of 17 high-quality foodwebs.While the niche and nested hierarchy models provide unbiased predictions on average, their 95{\%} confidence intervals frequently fail to include the observed data. Observed structural stabilities for all models are overdispersed compared to model predictions, and predicted and observed structural stabilities are uncorrelated, indicating that important sources of variation in structural stability are not captured by the models. Crucially, poor model performance arises because observed variation in structural stability is unrelated to variation in species richness and connectance. In contrast, almost all other measures of food web topology vary with species richness and connectance in natural webs. No model that takes species richness and connectance as the only input parameters can reproduce observed variation in structural stability. Further progress in predicting and explaining food web topology will require fundamentally new models based on different input parameters.},

abstract = {Enzyme sequences and structures are routinely used in the biological sciences as queries to search for functionally related enzymes in online databases. To this end, one usually departs from some notion of similarity, comparing two enzymes by looking for correspondences in their sequences, structures or surfaces. For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the enzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while information about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is ignored. In this work, we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved by applying kernel-based learning algorithms. This approach enables the detection of statistical dependencies between similarities of the active cleft and the biological function of annotated enzymes. This is in contrast to search-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into account. Similarity measures based on the active cleft are known to outperform sequence-based or structure-based measures under certain conditions. We consider the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification hierarchy for obtaining annotated enzymes during the training phase. The results of a set of sizeable experiments indicate a consistent and significant improvement for a set of similarity measures that exploit information about small cavities in the surface of enzymes.},

abstract = {Interpolation between pairs of values, typically vectors, is a funda- mental operation in many computer graphics applications. In some cases simple linear interpolation yields meaningful results without requiring domain knowledge. However, interpolation between pairs of distributions or pairs of functions often demands more care be- cause features may exhibit translational motion between exemplars. This property is not captured by linear interpolation. This paper de- velops the use of displacement interpolation for this class of prob- lem, which provides a generic method for interpolating between distributions or functions based on advection instead of blending. The functions can be non-uniformly sampled, high-dimensional, and defined on non-Euclidean manifolds, e.g., spheres and tori. Our method decomposes distributions or functions into sums of ra- dial basis functions (RBFs). We solve a mass transport problem to pair the RBFs and apply partial transport to obtain the interpo- lated function. We describe practical methods for computing the RBF decomposition and solving the transport problem. We demon- strate the interpolation approach on synthetic examples, BRDFs, color distributions, environment maps, stipple patterns, and value functions.},

abstract = {With chemical libraries increasingly containing millions of compounds or more, there is a fast-growing need for computational methods that can rank or prioritize compounds for screening. Machine learning methods have shown considerable promise for this task; indeed, classification methods such as support vector machines (SVMs), together with their variants, have been used in virtual screening to distinguish active compounds from inactive ones, while regression methods such as partial least-squares (PLS) and support vector regression (SVR) have been used in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for predicting biological activities of compounds. Recently, a new class of machine learning methods - namely, ranking methods, which are designed to directly optimize ranking performance - have been developed for ranking tasks such as web search that arise in information retrieval (IR) and other applications. Here we report the application of these new ranking methods in machine learning to the task of ranking chemical structures. Our experiments show that the new ranking methods give better ranking performance than both classification based methods in virtual screening and regression methods in QSAR analysis. We also make some interesting connections between ranking performance measures used in cheminformatics and those used in IR studies.},

abstract = {This article details a novel numerical scheme to approximate gradient flows for optimal transport (i.e. Wasserstein) metrics. These flows have proved useful to tackle theoretically and numerically non-linear diffusion equations that model for instance porous media or crowd evolutions. These gradient flows define a suitable notion of weak solutions for these evolutions and they can be approximated in a stable way using discrete flows. These discrete flows are implicit Euler time stepping according to the Wasserstein metric. A bottleneck of these approaches is the high computational load induced by the resolution of each step. Indeed, this corresponds to the resolution of a convex optimization problem involving a Wasserstein distance to the previous iterate. Following several recent works on the approximation of Wasserstein distances, we consider a discrete flow induced by an entropic regularization of the transportation coupling. This entropic regularization allows one to trade the initial Wasserstein fidelity term for a Kulback-Leibler divergence, which is easier to deal with numerically. We show how KL proximal schemes, and in particular Dykstra's algorithm, can be used to compute each step of the regularized flow. The resulting algorithm is both fast, parallelizable and versatile, because it only requires multiplications by a Gibbs kernel. On Euclidean domains discretized on an uniform grid, this corresponds to a linear filtering (for instance a Gaussian filtering when {\$}c{\$} is the squared Euclidean distance) which can be computed in nearly linear time. On more general domains, such as (possibly non-convex) shapes or on manifolds discretized by a triangular mesh, following a recently proposed numerical scheme for optimal transport, this Gibbs kernel multiplication is approximated by a short-time heat diffusion.},

To date, there have been no mechanistic or statistical explanations for the form of food web degree distributions. Here, I introduce models for food web degree distributions based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and show that the distributions of the number of consumers and resources in 23 (45{\%}) and 35 (69{\%}) of 51 food webs are not significantly different at a 95{\%} confidence level from the MaxEnt distribution. These findings offer a new null model for the most probable degree distributions in food webs and other networks. They suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring generalist or specialist consumption strategies but that biological drivers or methodological bias may force the consumer distribution away from the MaxEnt form.},

abstract = {The analysis of networks of ecological trophic transfers is a useful complement to simulation modeling in the quest for understanding whole-ecosystem dynamics. Trophic networks can be studied in quantitative and systematic fashion at several levels. Indirect relationships between any two individual taxa in an ecosystem, which often differ in either nature or magnitude from their direct influences, can be assayed using techniques from linear algebra. The same mathematics can also be employed to ascertain where along the trophic continuum any individual taxon is operating, or to map the web of connections into a virtual linear chain that summarizes trophodynamic performance by the system. Backtracking algorithms with pruning have been written which identify pathways for the recycle of materials and energy within the system. The pattern of such cycling often reveals modes of control or types of functions exhibited by various groups of taxa. The performance of the system as a whole at processing material and energy can be quantified using information theory. In particular, the complexity of process interactions can be parsed into separate terms that distinguish organized, efficient performance from the capacity for further development and recovery from disturbance. Finally, the sensitivities of the information-theoretic system indices appear to identify the dynamical bottlenecks in ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution.},

@article{Suweis2013,
abstract = {Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities 1–3 . Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture 4,5 independent of species composition and latitude 6,7 ; specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species 1 . Despite sustained efforts 5,8–10 to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stabi-lity or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus 11–13 . Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maxi-mizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nested-ness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational prin-ciple under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analyti-cally that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community. Our work provides a unifying frame-work for studying the emergent structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks 2,5,10,14 . Statistical analyses of empirical mutualistic networks indicate that a hierarchical nested structure is prevalent and is characterized by nested-ness values that are consistently higher than those found in randomly assembled networks with the same number of species and interactions 1,6 . Nevertheless, the degree of nestedness varies among networks. Recently 5,10 , it has been argued that nestedness increases biodiversity and begets stability, but these results are in conflict with robust theoretical evi-dences showing that ecological communities with nested interactions are inherently less stable than unstructured ones 12,14,15 and that mutua-lism could be detrimental to persistence 11,15 . We aim to elucidate gene-ral optimization mechanisms underlying network structure and its influence on community dynamics and stability. There is a venerable history of the use of variational principles for understanding nature, which has led to major advances in many sub-fields of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, relativity, and quantum mechanics. Our goal is to determine the appro-priate variational principle that characterizes a mutualistic community in the absence of detailed knowledge of the nature and strengths of the interactions between species and their environment. We begin by showing that increases in the abundances of the species lead to an increase in the total number of individuals (henceforth referred to as the total popu-lation) within the mutualistic community. We then show that, under stationary conditions, the total population is directly correlated with nestedness and vice versa. Finally, we demonstrate that nested mutua-listic communities are less resilient than communities in which species interact randomly. These results suggest a simple and general optim-ization principle: key aspects of mutualistic network structure and its dynamical properties could emerge as a consequence of the maximiza-tion of the species abundance in the mutualistic community (see Fig. 1). We consider a community comprising a total of S interacting species (see Methods), in which population dynamics is driven by interspecific interactions. We model mutualistic and competitive species interactions using both the classical Holling type I and II functional responses},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic interaction profiles are highly informative and helpful for understanding the functional linkages between genes, and therefore have been extensively exploited for annotating gene functions and dissecting specific pathway structures. However, our understanding is rather limited to the relationship between double concurrent perturbation and various higher level phenotypic changes, e.g. those in cells, tissues or organs. Modifier screens, such as synthetic genetic arrays (SGA) can help us to understand the phenotype caused by combined gene mutations. Unfortunately, exhaustive tests on all possible combined mutations in any genome are vulnerable to combinatorial explosion and are infeasible either technically or financially. Therefore, an accurate computational approach to predict genetic interaction is highly desirable, and such methods have the potential of alleviating the bottleneck on experiment design.

RESULTS: In this work, we introduce a computational systems biology approach for the accurate prediction of pairwise synthetic genetic interactions (SGI). First, a high-coverage and high-precision functional gene network (FGN) is constructed by integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI), protein complex and gene expression data; then, a graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) classifier is utilized to identify SGI, where the topological properties of protein pairs in weighted FGN is used as input features of the classifier. We compare the proposed SSL method with the state-of-the-art supervised classifier, the support vector machines (SVM), on a benchmark dataset in S. cerevisiae to validate our method's ability to distinguish synthetic genetic interactions from non-interaction gene pairs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately predict genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae (with a sensitivity of 92{\%} and specificity of 91{\%}). Noticeably, the SSL method is more efficient than SVM, especially for very small training sets and large test sets.

CONCLUSIONS: We developed a graph-based SSL classifier for predicting the SGI. The classifier employs topological properties of weighted FGN as input features and simultaneously employs information induced from labelled and unlabelled data. Our analysis indicates that the topological properties of weighted FGN can be employed to accurately predict SGI. Also, the graph-based SSL method outperforms the traditional standard supervised approach, especially when used with small training sets. The proposed method can alleviate experimental burden of exhaustive test and provide a useful guide for the biologist in narrowing down the candidate gene pairs with SGI. The data and source code implementing the method are available from the website: http://home.ustc.edu.cn/{\~{}}yzh33108/GeneticInterPred.htm.},

abstract = {The application of viral and cellular metagenomics to natural environments has expanded our understanding of the structure, functioning, and diversity of microbial and viral communities. The high diversity of many communities, e.g., soils, surface ocean waters, and animal-associated microbiomes, make it difficult to establish virus-host associations at the single cell (rather than population) level, assign cellular hosts, or determine the extent of viral host range from metagenomics studies alone. Here, we combine single-cell sequencing with environmental metagenomics to characterize the structure of virus–host associations in a Yellowstone National Park (YNP) hot spring microbial community. Leveraging the relatively low diversity of the YNP environment, we are able to overlay evidence at the single-cell level with contextualized viral and cellular community structure. Combining evidence from hexanucelotide analysis, single cell read mapping, network-based analytics, and CRISPR-based inference, we conservatively estimate that {\textgreater}60{\%} of cells contain at least one virus type and a majority of these cells contain two or more virus types. Of the detected virus types, nearly 50{\%} were found in more than 2 cellular clades, indicative of a broad host range. The new lens provided by the combination of metaviromics and single-cell genomics reveals a network of virus–host interactions in extreme environments, provides evidence that extensive virus–host associations are common, and further expands the unseen impact of viruses on cellular life.},

In contrast, in a spatially-structured population, there is a unique ESS for any given set of parameters; the outcome is determined by how effective allelopathy is in relation to its costs. Furthermore, in a spatially-structured environment, a dynamic equilibrium may be sustained among a colicin-sensitive type, a high colicin-producing type, and a "cheater" that expends less on colicin production but is resistant.

abstract = {The crystal structure of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics target APC35832, a 14.7-kDa cytosolic protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been determined at 1.3 A resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method from a mercury soaked crystal. The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

Extensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and practical achievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking, which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We compare and evaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the future developments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed.

abstract = {Passive acoustic sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, especially for echolocating bat species. To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats (BatDetect). Our deep learning algorithms (CNNFULL and CNNFAST) were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Romania and Bulgaria by citizen scientists as part of the iBats programme and labelled by users of www.batdetective.org. We compared the performance of our system to other algorithms and commercial systems on expert verified test datasets recorded from different sensors and countries. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on iBats monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system. Here, we show that both CNNFULL and CNNFAST deep learning algorithms have a higher detection performance (average precision, and recall) of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets, when compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems tested. Precision scores for commercial systems were reasonably good across all test datasets ({\textgreater}0.7), but this was at the expense of recall rates. In particular, our deep learning approaches were better at detecting calls in road-transect data, which contained more noisy recordings. Our comparison of CNNFULL and CNNFAST algorithms was favourable, although CNNFAST had a slightly poorer performance, displaying a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our example monitoring application demonstrated that our open-source, fully automatic, BatDetect CNNFAST pipeline does as well or better compared to a commercial system with manual verification previously used to analyse monitoring data. We show that it is possible to both accurately and automatically detect bat search-phase echolocation calls, particularly from noisy audio recordings. Our detection pipeline enables the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale, particularly when combined with automatic species identification. We release our system and datasets to encourage future progress and transparency.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process that directs the generation of different transcripts from single genes. A computational model that can accurately predict splicing patterns based on genomic features and cellular context is highly desirable, both in understanding this widespread phenomenon, and in exploring the effects of genetic variations on AS. METHODS: Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. RESULTS: We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset. An analysis of what the model has learned in terms of the genomic features is presented.},

abstract = {The published data for six melanocortin peptides binding to wild-type and chimeric melanocortin MC(1)/MC(3) receptors were analysed using the novel proteo-chemometrics modelling approach. The chimeric receptors and the peptides were coded using binary descriptors and used to correlate with the experimental data for affinity or selectivity for peptides binding to receptors. Correlations were achieved using partial least squares projection to latent structures (PLS) and statistically valid models were obtained. The models were further improved by adding cross-terms and applying orthogonal signal correction. The models were validated using external prediction, with half of the data being excluded from the modelling. Interpretation of the results using PLS coefficient plots revealed that the binding pocket for the melanocortins is located between the first, second, third, sixth and seventh transmembrane regions of the melanocortin receptors, in good agreement with previous three-dimensional models for the interactions of melanocortins with melanocortin receptors. Further, analysis of cross-terms between peptide descriptors indicated that the proteo-chemometrics modelling is able to distinguish between differences in the conformational space of the peptides that affect binding affinity and selectivity.},

However, 2SLS often fails to provide stable and accurate solutions, particularly for structural equation models with small samples. To address this issue, a regularized extension of 2SLS is proposed that integrates a ridge type of regularization into 2SLS, thereby enabling the method to effectively handle the small-sample-size problem. Results are then reported of a Monte Carlo study conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, as compared to its nonregularized counterpart. Finally, an application is presented that demonstrates the empirical usefulness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization techniques have been frequently applied in information retrieval, computer vision and pattern recognition. Among them, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has received considerable attention due to its psychological and physiological interpretation of naturally occurring data whose representation may be parts-based in the human brain. On the other hand, from the geometric perspective, the data is usually sampled from a low dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional ambient space. One hopes then to find a compact representation which uncovers the hidden semantics and simultaneously respects the intrinsic geometric structure. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called {\{}$\backslash$em Graph Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization{\}} (GNMF), for this purpose. In GNMF, an affinity graph is constructed to encode the geometrical information, and we seek a matrix factorization which respects the graph structure. Our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms on real world problems.},

Using the nuclear norm as a regularizer, we provide a simple and very efficient convex algorithm for minimizing the reconstruction error subject to a bound on the nuclear norm. Our algorithm Soft-Impute iteratively replaces the missing elements with those obtained from a soft-thresholded SVD. With warm starts this allows us to efficiently compute an entire regularization path of solutions on a grid of values of the regularization parameter. The computationally intensive part of our algorithm is in computing a low-rank SVD of a dense matrix. Exploiting the problem structure, we show that the task can be performed with a complexity linear in the matrix dimensions. Our semidefinite-programming algorithm is readily scalable to large matrices: for example it can obtain a rank-80 approximation of a 10(6) × 10(6) incomplete matrix with 10(5) observed entries in 2.5 hours, and can fit a rank 40 approximation to the full Netflix training set in 6.6 hours. Our methods show very good performance both in training and test error when compared to other competitive state-of-the art techniques.},

Serum samples from healthy individuals (n = 22) were also used as normal controls.

Interestingly, 16 of the 20 most significant miRNAs differentially expressed in serum samples were novel.

abstract = {Large simulations of bacterial colonies require huge amounts of computational time, the only way to achieve the necessary level of performance is with parallel computers and a suitably designed implementation that maps the problem onto the hardware. For real problems this mapping can be a non-trivial problem requiring careful consideration of the constraints in both the system being modelled and the hardware that executes that model. Here we describe an implementation of a system for modelling bacterial evolution that encompasses many physical scales. This system is composed entirely of individual entities all playing out a complex series of interactions. These individuals exist at the scale of the population of bacterial and at the gene product scale. This paper reports that it is possible to map a dynamic problem such as this onto fixed resources, for the most part making use of implicit multiplexing of resources provided by the OS and partitioning the problem to reduce communication time. Through this an efficient simulation can be created, making maximal use of the available hardware without constraining the model to require excessively specific resources.},

The train-ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net-works during either training or generation of samples.

abstract = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

abstract = {Process models specified by non-linear dynamic differential equations contain many parameters, which often must be inferred from a limited amount of data. We discuss a hierarchical Bayesian approach combining data from multiple related experiments in a meaningful way, which permits more powerful inference than treating each experiment as independent. The approach is illustrated with a simulation study and example data from experiments replicating the aspects of the human gut microbial ecosystem. A predictive model is obtained that contains prediction uncertainty caused by uncertainty in the parameters, and we extend the model to capture situations of interest that cannot easily be studied experimentally.},

abstract = {The statistical properties of ecological time series data and general trends therein have historically been of great interest to ecologists. In recent years, there has been a focus on establishing the relative importance of 'memory' in these data. The classic study by Pimm {\&} Redfearn (1988 Nature, 334, 613-614) has been extremely important in establishing within the ecological community the idea that population time series are generally 'red-shifted' (dominated by long-term trends). This conclusion was reached by exploring the relationship between observed variability and census length in ecological data and comparing them with those for artificially generated data. Here, we highlight some subtle problems with this approach and suggest possible alternative methods of analysis, especially when the time series of interest are short.},

Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as the number k of clusters increases.

abstract = {Global concern regarding pollinator decline has intensified interest in enhancing pollinator resources in managed landscapes. These efforts frequently emphasize restoration or planting of flowering plants to provide pollen and nectar resources that are highly attractive to the desired pollinators. However, determining exactly which plant species should be used to enhance a landscape is difficult. Empirical screening of plants for such purposes is logistically daunting, but could be streamlined by crowdsourcing data to create lists of plants most probable to attract the desired pollinator taxa. People frequently photograph plants in bloom and the Internet has become a vast repository of such images. A proportion of these images also capture floral visitation by arthropods. Here, we test the hypothesis that the abundance of floral images containing identifiable pollinator and other beneficial insects is positively associated with the observed attractiveness of the same species in controlled field trials from previously published studies. We used Google Image searches to determine the correlation of pollinator visitation captured by photographs on the Internet relative to the attractiveness of the same species in common-garden field trials for 43 plant species. From the first 30 photographs, which successfully identified the plant, we recorded the number of Apis (managed honeybees), non-Apis (exclusively wild bees) and the number of bee-mimicking syrphid flies. We used these observations from search hits as well as bloom period (BP) as predictor variables in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for field-observed abundances of each of these groups. We found that non-Apis bees observed in controlled field trials were positively associated with observations of these taxa in Google Image searches (pseudo-R 2 of 0.668). Syrphid fly observations in the field were also associated with the frequency they were observed in images, but this relationship was weak. Apis bee observations were not associated with Internet images, but were slightly associated with BP. Our results suggest that passively crowdsourced image data can potentially be a useful screening tool to identify candidate plants for pollinator habitat restoration efforts directed at wild bee conservation.

For this purpose, the emerging field of chemical genomics is currently focused on accumulating large assay data sets describing compound-protein interactions (CPIs). Although new target proteins for known drugs have recently been identified through mining of CPI databases, using these resources to identify novel ligands remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that machine learning of multiple CPIs can not only assess drug polypharmacology but can also efficiently identify novel bioactive scaffold-hopping compounds. Through a machine-learning technique that uses multiple CPIs, we have successfully identified novel lead compounds for two pharmaceutically important protein families, G-protein-coupled receptors and protein kinases. These novel compounds were not identified by existing computational ligand-screening methods in comparative studies. The results of this study indicate that data derived from chemical genomics can be highly useful for exploring chemical space, and this systems biology perspective could accelerate drug discovery processes.},

abstract = {Network-based intervention has been a trend of curing systemic diseases, but it relies on regimen optimization and valid multi-target actions of the drugs. The complex multi-component nature of medicinal herbs may serve as valuable resources for network-based multi-target drug discovery due to its potential treatment effects by synergy. Recently, robustness of multiple systems biology platforms shows powerful to uncover molecular mechanisms and connections between the drugs and their targeting dynamic network. However, optimization methods of drug combination are insufficient, owning to lacking of tighter integration across multiple '-omics' databases. The newly developed algorithm- or network-based computational models can tightly integrate '-omics' databases and optimize combinational regimens of drug development, which encourage using medicinal herbs to develop into new wave of network-based multi-target drugs. However, challenges on further integration across the databases of medicinal herbs with multiple system biology platforms for multi-target drug optimization remain to the uncertain reliability of individual data sets, width and depth and degree of standardization of herbal medicine. Standardization of the methodology and terminology of multiple system biology and herbal database would facilitate the integration. Enhance public accessible databases and the number of research using system biology platform on herbal medicine would be helpful. Further integration across various '-omics' platforms and computational tools would accelerate development of network-based drug discovery and network medicine.},

abstract = {We characterize the asymptotic performance of nonparametric goodness of fit testing, otherwise known as the universal hypothesis testing that dates back to Hoeffding (1965). The exponential decay rate of the type-II error probability is used as the asymptotic performance metric, hence an optimal test achieves the maximum decay rate subject to a constant level constraint on the type-I error probability. We show that two classes of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) based tests attain this optimality on R d , while a Ker-nel Stein Discrepancy (KSD) based test achieves a weaker one under this criterion. In the finite sample regime, these tests have similar statistical performance in our experiments, while the KSD based test is more computationally efficient. Key to our approach are Sanov's theorem from large deviation theory and recent results on the weak convergence properties of the MMD and KSD.},

abstract = {Reverse-engineering of high-dimensional dynamical systems from time-course data still remains a challenging and important problem in knowledge discovery. For this learning task, a number of approaches primarily based on sparse linear models or Granger causality concepts have been proposed in the literature. However, when a system exhibits nonlinear dynamics, there does not exist a systematic approach that takes into account the nature of the underlying system. In this work, we introduce a novel family of vector autore-gressive models based on different operator-valued kernels to identify the dynamical system and retrieve the target network that characterizes the interactions of its components. Assum-ing a sparse underlying structure, a key challenge, also present in the linear case, is to control the model's sparsity. This is achieved through the joint learning of the structure of the kernel and the basis vectors. To solve this learning task, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm based on proximal gradient procedures that learns both the structure of the ker- 123 490 Mach Learn (2015) 99:489–513 nel and the basis vectors. Results on the DREAM3 competition gene regulatory benchmark networks of sizes 10 and 100 show the new model outperforms existing methods. Another application of the model on climate data identifies interesting and interpretable interactions between natural and human activity factors, thus confirming the ability of the learning scheme to retrieve dependencies between state-variables.},

However, it has simultaneously complicated the problem of extracting meaningful molecular signatures of biological processes from these complex datasets. The process of biomarker discovery and characterization provides opportunities for more sophisticated approaches to integrating purely statistical and expert knowledge-based approaches. Areas covered—In this review we will present examples of current practices for biomarker discovery from complex omic datasets and the challenges that have been encountered in deriving valid and useful signatures of disease. We will then present a high-level review of data-driven (statistical) and knowledge-based methods applied to biomarker discovery, highlighting some current efforts to combine the two distinct approaches. Expert opinion—Effective, reproducible and objective tools for combining data-driven and knowledge-based approaches to identify predictive signatures of disease are key to future success in the biomarker field. We will describe our recommendations for possible approaches to this problem including metrics for the evaluation of biomarkers.},

abstract = {PHASTER (PHAge Search Tool – Enhanced Release) is a significant upgrade to the popular PHAST web server for the rapid identification and annotation of prophage sequences within bacterial genomes and plasmids. Although the steps in the phage identification pipeline in PHASTER remain largely the same as in the original PHAST, numerous software improvements and significant hardware enhancements have now made PHASTER faster, more efficient, more visually appealing and much more user friendly. In particular, PHASTER is now 4.3× faster than PHAST when analyzing a typical bacterial genome. More specifically, software optimizations have made the backend of PHASTER 2.7X faster than PHAST, while the addition of 80 CPUs to the PHASTER compute cluster are responsible for the remaining speed-up. PHASTER can now process a typical bacterial genome in 3 min from the raw sequence alone, or in 1.5 min when given a pre-annotated GenBank file. A number of other optimizations have also been implemented, including automated algorithms to reduce the size and redundancy of PHASTER's databases, improvements in handling multiple (metagenomic) queries and higher user traffic, along with the ability to perform automated look-ups against 14 000 previously PHAST/PHASTER annotated bacterial genomes (which can lead to complete phage annotations in seconds as opposed to minutes). PHASTER's web interface has also been entirely rewritten. A new graphical genome browser has been added, gene/genome visualization tools have been improved, and the graphical interface is now more modern, robust and user-friendly. PHASTER is available online at www.phaster.ca.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

However, these techniques are only able to reveal linear relationships in data. Although nonlinear variants of PCA and CCA have been proposed, these are computationally prohibitive in the large scale. In a separate strand of recent research, randomized methods have been proposed to construct features that help reveal nonlinear patterns in data. For basic tasks such as regression or classification, random features exhibit little or no loss in performance, while achieving drastic savings in computational requirements. In this paper we leverage randomness to design scalable new variants of nonlinear PCA and CCA; our ideas extend to key multivariate analysis tools such as spectral clustering or LDA. We demonstrate our algorithms through experiments on real-world data, on which we compare against the state-of-the-art. A simple R implementation of the presented algorithms is provided.},

Three rhizobial strains were found to strongly stimulate the growth and methane oxidation of M. miyakonense HT12 in cocultures. We purified the stimulating factor produced by Rhizobium sp.

abstract = {This article reviews the relatively short history of metabolic pathway analysis. Computer-aided algorithms for the synthesis of metabolic pathways are discussed. Important algebraic concepts used in pathway analysis, such as null space and convex cone, are explained. It is demonstrated how these concepts can be translated into meaningful metabolic concepts. For example, it is shown that the simplest vectors spanning the region of all admissible fluxes in stationary states, for which the term elementary flux modes was coined, correspond to fundamental pathways in the system. The concepts are illustrated with the help of a reaction scheme representing the glyoxylate cycle and adjacent reactions of aspartate and glutamate synthesis. The interrelations between pathway analysis and metabolic control theory are outlined. Promising applications for genome annotation and for biotechnological purposes are discussed. Armed with a better understanding of the architecture of cellular metabolism and the enormous amount of genomic data available today, biochemists and biotechnologists will be able to draw the entire metabolic map of a cell and redesign it by rational and directed metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {A long-standing theory, originating with Darwin, suggests that abiotic forces set species range limits at high latitude, high elevation, and other abiotically ‘stressful' areas, while species interactions set range limits in apparently more benign regions. This theory is of considerable importance for both basic and applied ecology, and while it is often assumed to be a ubiquitous pattern, it has not been clearly defined or broadly tested. We review tests of this idea and dissect how the strength of species interactions must vary across stress gradients to generate the predicted pattern. We conclude by suggesting approaches to better test this theory, which will deepen our understanding of the forces that determine species ranges and govern responses to climate change.},

abstract = {Developing theoretical foundations for learning is a key step towards understanding intelligence. 'Learning from examples' is a paradigm in which systems (natural or artificial) learn a functional relationship from a training set of examples. Within this paradigm, a learning algorithm is a map from the space of training sets to the hypothesis space of possible functional solutions. A central question for the theory is to determine conditions under which a learning algorithm will generalize from its finite training set to novel examples. A milestone in learning theory was a characterization of conditions on the hypothesis space that ensure generalization for the natural class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) learning algorithms that are based on minimizing the error on the training set. Here we provide conditions for generalization in terms of a precise stability property of the learning process: when the training set is perturbed by deleting one example, the learned hypothesis does not change much. This stability property stipulates conditions on the learning map rather than on the hypothesis space, subsumes the classical theory for ERM algorithms, and is applicable to more general algorithms. The surprising connection between stability and predictivity has implications for the foundations of learning theory and for the design of novel algorithms, and provides insights into problems as diverse as language learning and inverse problems in physics and engineering.},

Biological and chemical databases are increasingly being populated with linkages between protein sequences and chemical structures. There is now sufficient information to apply machine-learning techniques to predict interactions between chemicals and proteins at a genome scale. Current machine-learning techniques use as input either protein sequences and structures or chemical information. We propose here a method to infer protein-chemical interactions using heterogeneous input consisting of both protein sequence and chemical information. RESULTS: Our method relies on expressing proteins and chemicals with a common cheminformatics representation. We demonstrate our approach by predicting whether proteins can catalyze reactions not present in training sets. We also predict whether a given drug can bind a target, in the absence of prior binding information for that drug and target. Such predictions cannot be made with current machine-learning techniques requiring binding information for individual reactions or individual targets.},

abstract = {In natural communities, species and their interactions are often organized as nonrandom networks, showing distinct and repeated complex patterns. A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with {\textgreater}150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with {\textless}50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15{\%} of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks comprise a subclass of deep neural networks (DNN) with a constrained architecture that leverages the spatial and temporal structure of the domain they model. Convolutional networks achieve the best predictive performance in areas such as speech and image recognition by hierarchically composing simple local features into complex models. Although DNNs have been used in drug discovery for QSAR and ligand-based bioactivity predictions, none of these models have benefited from this powerful convolutional architecture. This paper introduces AtomNet, the first structure-based, deep convolutional neural network designed to predict the bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery applications. We demonstrate how to apply the convolutional concepts of feature locality and hierarchical composition to the modeling of bioactivity and chemical interactions. In further contrast to existing DNN techniques, we show that AtomNet's application of local convolutional filters to structural target information successfully predicts new active molecules for targets with no previously known modulators. Finally, we show that AtomNet outperforms previous docking approaches on a diverse set of benchmarks by a large margin, achieving an AUC greater than 0.9 on 57.8{\%} of the targets in the DUDE benchmark.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In silico prediction of drug-target interactions from heterogeneous biological data is critical in the search for drugs for known diseases. This problem is currently being attacked from many different points of view, a strong indication of its current importance. Precisely, being able to predict new drug-target interactions with both high precision and accuracy is the holy grail, a fundamental requirement for in silico methods to be useful in a biological setting. This, however, remains extremely challenging due to, amongst other things, the rarity of known drug-target interactions. RESULTS: We propose a novel supervised inference method to predict unknown drug-target interactions, represented as a bipartite graph. We use this method, known as bipartite local models to first predict target proteins of a given drug, then to predict drugs targeting a given protein. This gives two independent predictions for each putative drug-target interaction, which we show can be combined to give a definitive prediction for each interaction. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in the prediction of four classes of drug-target interaction networks involving enzymes, ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors in human. This enables us to suggest a number of new potential drug-target interactions. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the proposed algorithm is available upon request from the authors.

This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

abstract = {Invasive alien plants can compete with native plants for resources, and may ultimately decrease native plant diversity and/or abundance in invaded sites. This could have consequences for native mutualistic interactions, such as pollination. Although invasive plants often become highly connected in plant-pollinator interaction networks, in temperate climates they usually only flower for part of the season. Unless sufficient alternative plants flower outside this period, whole-season floral resources may be reduced by invasion. We hypothesized that the cessation of flowering of a dominant invasive plant would lead to dramatic, seasonal compositional changes in plant-pollinator communities, and subsequent changes in network structure. We investigated variation in floral resources, flower-visiting insect communities, and interaction networks during and after the flowering of invasive Rhododendron ponticum in four invaded Irish woodland sites. Floral resources decreased significantly after R. ponticum flowering, but the magnitude of the decrease varied among sites. Neither insect abundance nor richness varied between the two periods (during and after R. ponticum flowering), yet insect community composition was distinct, mostly due to a significant reduction in Bombus abundance after flowering. During flowering R. ponticum was frequently visited by Bombus; after flowering, these highly mobile pollinators presumably left to find alternative floral resources. Despite compositional changes, however, network structural properties remained stable after R. ponticum flowering ceased: generality increased, but quantitative connectance, interaction evenness, vulnerability, H'2 and network size did not change. This is likely because after R. ponticum flowering, two to three alternative plant species became prominent in networks and insects increased their diet breadth, as indicated by the increase in network-level generality. We conclude that network structure is robust to seasonal changes in floral abundance at sites invaded by alien, mass-flowering plant species, as long as alternative floral resources remain throughout the season to support the flower-visiting community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a high throughput setting, effective flow cytometry data analysis depends heavily on proper data preprocessing. While usual preprocessing steps of quality assessment, outlier removal, normalization, and gating have received considerable scrutiny from the community, the influence of data transformation on the output of high throughput analysis has been largely overlooked. Flow cytometry measurements can vary over several orders of magnitude, cell populations can have variances that depend on their mean fluorescence intensities, and may exhibit heavily-skewed distributions. Consequently, the choice of data transformation can influence the output of automated gating. An appropriate data transformation aids in data visualization and gating of cell populations across the range of data. Experience shows that the choice of transformation is data specific. Our goal here is to compare the performance of different transformations applied to flow cytometry data in the context of automated gating in a high throughput, fully automated setting. We examine the most common transformations used in flow cytometry, including the generalized hyperbolic arcsine, biexponential, linlog, and generalized Box-Cox, all within the BioConductor flowCore framework that is widely used in high throughput, automated flow cytometry data analysis. All of these transformations have adjustable parameters whose effects upon the data are non-intuitive for most users. By making some modelling assumptions about the transformed data, we develop maximum likelihood criteria to optimize parameter choice for these different transformations.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRESULTS: We compare the performance of parameter-optimized and default-parameter (in flowCore) data transformations on real and simulated data by measuring the variation in the locations of cell populations across samples, discovered via automated gating in both the scatter and fluorescence channels. We find that parameter-optimized transformations improve visualization, reduce variability in the location of discovered cell populations across samples, and decrease the misclassification (mis-gating) of individual events when compared to default-parameter counterparts.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the preferred transformation for fluorescence channels is a parameter- optimized biexponential or generalized Box-Cox, in accordance with current best practices. Interestingly, for populations in the scatter channels, we find that the optimized hyperbolic arcsine may be a better choice in a high-throughput setting than current standard practice of no transformation. However, generally speaking, the choice of transformation remains data-dependent. We have implemented our algorithm in the BioConductor package, flowTrans, which is publicly available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information. They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging bacterial zoonoses in bats and rodents remain relatively understudied. We conduct the first comparative host-pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. as a model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. Bartonella spp. and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P{\textless}/=0.001; m2 global value = 7.3320, P{\textless}/=0.0001). Bartonella spp. and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation (ParaFitGlobal = 102.4409, P{\textless}/=0.001; m2 global value = 86.532, P{\textless}/=0.0001). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in Leptospira and bats (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m2 global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Separate analyses of New World and Old World data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets. We also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches. Reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology.

@article{Graves2016,
abstract = {Modern computers separate computation and memory. Computation is performed by a processor, which can use an addressable memory to bring operands in and out of play. This confers two important benefits: the use of extensible storage to write new information and the ability to treat the contents of memory as variables. Variables are critical to algorithm generality: to perform the same procedure on one datum or another, an algorithm merely has to change the address it reads from. In contrast to computers, the computational and memory resources of artificial neural networks are mixed together in the network weights and neuron activity. This is a major liability: as the memory demands of a task increase, these networks cannot allocate new storage dynam-ically, nor easily learn algorithms that act independently of the values realized by the task variables. Although recent breakthroughs demonstrate that neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing 1 , sequence learning 2,3 and reinforcement learning 4 , cognitive scientists and neuroscientists have argued that neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures 5–9 , and to store data over long timescales without interference 10,11 . We aim to combine the advantages of neu-ral and computational processing by providing a neural network with read–write access to external memory. The access is narrowly focused, minimizing interference among memoranda and enabling long-term storage 12,13 . The whole system is differentiable, and can therefore be trained end-to-end with gradient descent, allowing the network to learn how to operate and organize the memory in a goal-directed manner.},

Our main selection strategy is based on the maximum margin hyperplane-generated by "Support Vector Machines". This hyperplane separates the current set of active from the inactive compounds and has the largest possible distance from any labeled compound. We perform a thorough comparative study of various other selection strategies on data sets provided by DuPont Pharmaceuticals and show that the strategies based on the maximum margin hyperplane clearly outperform the simpler ones.},

abstract = {Despite a strong current interest in ecological networks, the bulk of studies are static descriptions of the structure of networks, and very few analyze their temporal dynamics. Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.},

@article{Hu2008,
abstract = {The hypothesis that early flowering plants were insect-pollinated could be tested by an examination of the pollination biology of basal angiosperms and the pollination modes of fossil angiosperms. We provide data to show that early fossil angiosperms were insect-pollinated. Eighty-six percent of 29 extant basal angiosperm families have species that are zoophilous (of which 34{\%} are specialized) and 17{\%} of the families have species that are wind-pollinated, whereas basal eudicot families and basal monocot families more commonly have wind and specialized pollination modes (up to 78{\%}). Character reconstruction based on recent molecular trees of angiosperms suggests that the most parsimonious result is that zoophily is the ancestral state. Combining pollen ornamentation, size, and aperture characteristics and the abundance of single-species pollen clumps of Cenomanian angiosperm-dispersed pollen species from the Dakota Formation demonstrates a dominance of zoophilous pollination (76{\%} versus 24{\%} wind pollination). The zoophilous pollen species have adaptations for pollination by generalist insects (39{\%}), specialized pollen-collecting insects (27{\%}), and other specialized pollinators (10{\%}). These data quantify the presences of more specialized pollination modes during the mid-Cretaceous angiosperm diversification.},

abstract = {While host-species diversity often influences microbial prevalence, there may be multiple mechanisms causing such effects that may also depend on the foraging strategy of the microbes. We employed a natural gradient of rodent-species richness to examine competing hypotheses describing possible mechanisms mediating the relationship between host-species richness and the prevalence of the most dominant microbes, along with microbe specificity to the different rodent host species. We sampled blood from three gerbil species in plots differing in terms of the proportion of the different species and screened for the most dominant bacteria. Two dominant bacterial lineages were detected: host-specific bacteria and host-opportunistic bacteria. Using a model selection approach, we detected evidence for both direct and indirect effects of host-species richness on the prevalence of these bacteria. Infection probability of the host-specific lineage was lower in richer host communities, most likely due to increased frequency and density of the least suitable host species. In contrast, field observations suggest that the effect of host-species richness on infection probability of the opportunistic lineage was both direct and indirect, mostly mediated by changes in flea densities on the host and by the presence of the host-specific lineage. Our results thus suggest that host-species richness has multiple effects on microbial prevalence, depending on the degree of host-specificity of the microbe in question.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of {\textgreater}2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their ‘resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the services that they underpin.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps provide insight into cellular biology and have received considerable attention in the post-genomic era. While large-scale experimental approaches have generated large collections of experimentally determined PPIs, technical limitations preclude certain PPIs from detection. Recently, we demonstrated that yeast PPIs can be computationally predicted using re-occurring short polypeptide sequences between known interacting protein pairs. However, the computational requirements and low specificity made this method unsuitable for large-scale investigations. Here, we report an improved approach, which exhibits a specificity of approximately 99.95{\%} and executes 16,000 times faster. Importantly, we report the first all-to-all sequence-based computational screen of PPIs in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which we identify 29,589 high confidence interactions of approximately 2 x 10(7) possible pairs. Of these, 14,438 PPIs have not been previously reported and may represent novel interactions. In particular, these results reveal a richer set of membrane protein interactions, not readily amenable to experimental investigations. From the novel PPIs, a novel putative protein complex comprised largely of membrane proteins was revealed. In addition, two novel gene functions were predicted and experimentally confirmed to affect the efficiency of non-homologous end-joining, providing further support for the usefulness of the identified PPIs in biological investigations.},

The infinite-label learning fundamentally expands the scope of conventional multi-label learning, and better models the practical requirements in various real-world applications, such as image tagging, ads-query association, and article categorization. However, how can we learn a labeling function that is capable of assigning to a data point the labels omitted from the training set? To answer the question, we seek some clues from the recent work on zero-shot learning, where the key is to represent a class/label by a vector of semantic codes, as opposed to treating them as atomic labels. We validate the infinite-label learning by a PAC bound in theory and some empirical studies on both synthetic and real data.},

abstract = {Interactions between bacteria and the viruses that infect them (i.e., phages) have profound effects on biological processes, but despite their importance, little is known on the general structure of infection and resistance between most phages and bacteria. For example, are bacteria-phage communities characterized by complex patterns of overlapping exploitation networks, do they conform to a more ordered general pattern across all communities, or are they idiosyncratic and hard to predict from one ecosystem to the next? To answer these questions, we collect and present a detailed metaanalysis of 38 laboratory-verified studies of host-phage interactions representing almost 12,000 distinct experimental infection assays across a broad spectrum of taxa, habitat, and mode of selection. In so doing, we present evidence that currently available host-phage infection networks are statistically different from random networks and that they possess a characteristic nested structure. This nested structure is typified by the finding that hard to infect bacteria are infected by generalist phages (and not specialist phages) and that easy to infect bacteria are infected by generalist and specialist phages. Moreover, we find that currently available host-phage infection networks do not typically possess a modular structure. We explore possible underlying mechanisms and significance of the observed nested host-phage interaction structure. In addition, given that most of the available host-phage infection networks examined here are composed of taxa separated by short phylogenetic distances, we propose that the lack of modularity is a scale-dependent effect, and then, we describe experimental studies to test whether modular patterns exist at macroevolutionary scales.},

Although efforts have been devoted to the development of methodology for predicting PPIs and protein interaction networks, the application of most existing methods is limited because they need information about protein homology or the interaction marks of the protein partners. In the present work, we propose a method for PPI prediction using only the information of protein sequences. This method was developed based on a learning algorithm-support vector machine combined with a kernel function and a conjoint triad feature for describing amino acids. More than 16,000 diverse PPI pairs were used to construct the universal model. The prediction ability of our approach is better than that of other sequence-based PPI prediction methods because it is able to predict PPI networks. Different types of PPI networks have been effectively mapped with our method, suggesting that, even with only sequence information, this method could be applied to the exploration of networks for any newly discovered protein with unknown biological relativity. In addition, such supplementary experimental information can enhance the prediction ability of the method.},

abstract = {We present Procrustean Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo), a novel statistical tool to test for congruence between phylogenetic trees, or between phylogenetic distance matrices of associated taxa. Unlike previous tests, PACo evaluates the dependence of one phylogeny upon the other. This makes it especially appropriate to test the classical coevolutionary model that assumes that parasites that spend part of their life in or on their hosts track the phylogeny of their hosts. The new method does not require fully resolved phylogenies and allows for multiple host-parasite associations. PACo produces a Procrustes superimposition plot enabling a graphical assessment of the fit of the parasite phylogeny onto the host phylogeny and a goodness-of-fit statistic, whose significance is established by randomization of the host-parasite association data. The contribution of each individual host-parasite association to the global fit is measured by means of jackknife estimation of their respective squared residuals and confidence intervals associated to each host-parasite link. We carried out different simulations to evaluate the performance of PACo in terms of Type I and Type II errors with respect to two similar published tests. In most instances, PACo performed at least as well as the other tests and showed higher overall statistical power. In addition, the jackknife estimation of squared residuals enabled more elaborate validations about the nature of individual links than the ParaFitLink1 test of the program ParaFit. In order to demonstrate how it can be used in real biological situations, we applied PACo to two published studies using a script written in the public-domain statistical software R.},

We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neural- and placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Ecological networks are complexes of interacting species, but not all potential links among species are realized. Unobserved links are either missing or forbidden. Missing links exist, but require more sampling or alternative ways of detection to be verified. Forbidden links remain unobservable, irrespective of sampling effort. They are caused by linkage constraints. We studied one Arctic pollination network and two Mediterranean seed-dispersal networks. In the first, for example, we recorded flower-visit links for one full season, arranged data in an interaction matrix and got a connectance C of 15 per cent. Interaction accumulation curves documented our sampling of interactions through observation of visits to be robust. Then, we included data on pollen from the body surface of flower visitors as an additional link 'currency'. This resulted in 98 new links, missing from the visitation data. Thus, the combined visit-pollen matrix got an increased C of 20 per cent. For the three networks, C ranged from 20 to 52 per cent, and thus the percentage of unobserved links (100 - C) was 48 to 80 per cent; these were assumed forbidden because of linkage constraints and not missing because of under-sampling. Phenological uncoupling (i.e. non-overlapping phenophases between interacting mutualists) is one kind of constraint, and it explained 22 to 28 per cent of all possible, but unobserved links. Increasing phenophase overlap between species increased link probability, but extensive overlaps were required to achieve a high probability. Other kinds of constraint, such as size mismatch and accessibility limitations, are briefly addressed.},

abstract = {Advances in qPCR technology allow studies of increasingly large systems comprising many genes and samples. The increasing data sizes allow expression profiling both in the gene and the samples dimension while also putting higher demands on sound statistical analysis and expertise to handle and interpret its results. We distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory statistical studies. In this paper we demonstrate several techniques available for exploratory studies on a system of Xenopus laevis development from egg to tadpole. Techniques include hierarchical clustering, heatmap, principal component analysis and self-organizing maps. We stress that even though exploratory studies are excellent for generating hypotheses, results have not been proven statistically significant until an independent confirmatory study has been performed. An exploratory study may certainly be valuable in its own right, and there are often not enough resources to report both an exploratory and a confirmatory study at the same time. However, exploratory and confirmatory studies are intimately connected and we would like to raise that awareness among qPCR practitioners. We suggest that scientific reports should always have a hypothesis focus. Reports are either hypothesis generating, from an exploratory study, or hypothesis validating, from a confirmatory study, or both. In either case, we suggest the generated or validated hypotheses be specifically stated.},

abstract = {Factorization approaches provide high accuracy in several important prediction problems, for example, recommender systems. However, applying factorization approaches to a new prediction problem is a nontrivial task and requires a lot of expert knowledge. Typically, a new model is developed, a learning algorithm is derived, and the approach has to be implemented. Factorization machines (FM) are a generic approach since they can mimic most factorization models just by feature engineering. This way, factorization machines combine the generality of feature engineering with the superiority of factorization models in estimating interactions between categorical variables of large domain. LIBFM is a software implementation for factorization machines that features stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and alternating least-squares (ALS) optimization, as well as Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monto Carlo (MCMC). This article summarizes the recent research on factorization machines both in terms of modeling and learning, provides extensions for the ALS and MCMC algorithms, and describes the software tool LIBFM.},

abstract = {The structural genomics projects have been accumulating an increasing number of protein structures, many of which remain functionally unknown. In parallel effort to experimental methods, computational methods are expected to make a significant contribution for functional elucidation of such proteins. However, conventional computational methods that transfer functions from homologous proteins do not help much for these uncharacterized protein structures because they do not have apparent structural or sequence similarity with the known proteins. Here, we briefly review two avenues of computational function prediction methods, i.e. structure-based methods and sequence-based methods. The focus is on our recent developments of local structure-based and sequence-based methods, which can effectively extract function information from distantly related proteins. Two structure-based methods, Pocket-Surfer and Patch-Surfer, identify similar known ligand binding sites for pocket regions in a query protein without using global protein fold similarity information. Two sequence-based methods, protein function prediction and extended similarity group, make use of weakly similar sequences that are conventionally discarded in homology based function annotation. Combined together with experimental methods we hope that computational methods will make leading contribution in functional elucidation of the protein structures.},

We measure such functions in terms of the synthesizing capacity of a network when it is provided with a few small chemical substances as external resources. We call this measure the scope and show that it is generally robust against structural alterations of the reaction network. Organisms can be separated into two groups, one with a small and one with a large scope. Networks with a high synthesizing capacity also show a high degree of robustness against structural changes, indicating that this network function has been a target in the evolutionary past of the corresponding organisms. A comparison between structural and functional similarities reveals that organisms with a similar structure do not necessarily show similar biological functions. The presented concepts allow for a systematic investigation of structure-function relationships of metabolic networks and may put forth valuable hints on the evolution of metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {The occurrence of complex networks of interactions among species not only relies on species co-occurrence, but also on inherited traits and evolutionary events imprinted in species phylogenies. The phylogenetic signal found in ecological networks suggests that evolution plays an important role in determining community assembly and hence could inform about the underpinning mechanisms. The aim of this study was to review the main findings and methodological approaches used for detecting phylogenetic signal in species interaction networks, particularly in different aspects of network structure: conservatism of interactions, modularity, connectivity and nestedness. In general, studies show that species phylogenies determine interacting partners, module composition, species roles and nested patterns, although these influences are not always consistent across different interaction types. The relative importance of phylogeny to network structure, as well as the scale-dependence of phylogenetic signal, denote key areas for future research. Phylogenetically-informed network ecology represents a promising field for understanding species interaction patterns, community assembly processes and dynamics. It can also provide important information for predicting community changes and improving management practices. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability-including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members-and support our key predictions with recent data.},

abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15{\%}−64{\%} compared to existing baselines.},

abstract = {The network of biomolecular interactions that occurs within cells is large and complex. When such a network is analyzed, it can be helpful to reduce the complexity of the network to a "kernel" that maintains the essential regulatory functions for the output under consideration. We developed an algorithm to identify such a kernel and showed that the resultant kernel preserves the network dynamics. Using an integrated network of all of the human signaling pathways retrieved from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database, we identified this network's kernel and compared the properties of the kernel to those of the original network. We found that the percentage of essential genes to the genes encoding nodes outside of the kernel was about 10{\%}, whereas {\~{}}32{\%} of the genes encoding nodes within the kernel were essential. In addition, we found that 95{\%} of the kernel nodes corresponded to Mendelian disease genes and that 93{\%} of synthetic lethal pairs associated with the network were contained in the kernel. Genes corresponding to nodes in the kernel had low evolutionary rates, were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, and were well conserved between species. Furthermore, kernel genes included many drug targets, suggesting that other kernel nodes may be potential drug targets. Owing to the simplification of the entire network, the efficient modeling of a large-scale signaling network and an understanding of the core structure within a complex framework become possible.},

abstract = {Epidemiological networks are commonly used to explore dynamics of parasite transmission among individuals in a population of a given host species. However, many parasites infect multiple host species, and thus multi-host networks may offer a better framework for investigating parasite dynamics. We investigated the factors that influence parasite sharing--and thus potential transmission pathways--among rodent hosts in Southeast Asia. We focused on differences between networks of a single host species and networks that involve multiple host species. In host-parasite networks, modularity (the extent to which the network is divided into subgroups of rodents that interact with similar parasites) was higher in the multi-species than in the single-species networks. This suggests that phylogeny affects patterns of parasite sharing, which was confirmed in analyses showing that it predicted affiliation of individuals to modules. We then constructed "potential transmission networks" based on the host-parasite networks, in which edges depict the similarity between a pair of individuals in the parasites they share. The centrality of individuals in these networks differed between multi- and single-species networks, with species identity and individual characteristics influencing their position in the networks. Simulations further revealed that parasite dynamics differed between multi- and single-species networks. We conclude that multi-host networks based on parasite sharing can provide new insights into the potential for transmission among hosts in an ecological community. In addition, the factors that determine the nature of parasite sharing (i.e. structure of the host-parasite network) may impact transmission patterns.},

Using a training data set that contains the genotypic and phenotypic information of a large number of individuals, each marker or marker allele is associated with an estimated effect on the trait under study. These estimated marker effects are subsequently used for making predictions on individuals for which no phenotypic records are available. As most plant and animal breeding programs are currently still phenotype driven, the continuously expanding collection of phenotypic records can only be used to construct a genomic prediction model if a dense molecular marker fingerprint is available for each phenotyped individual. However, as the genotyping budget is generally limited, the genomic prediction model can only be constructed using a subset of the tested individuals and possibly a genome-covering subset of the molecular markers. In this article, we demonstrate how an optimal selection of individuals can be made with respect to the quality of their available phenotypic data. We also demonstrate how the total number of molecular markers can be reduced while a maximum genome coverage is ensured. The third selection problem we tackle is specific to the construction of a genomic prediction model for a hybrid breeding program where only molecular marker fingerprints of the homozygous parents are available. We show how to identify the set of parental inbred lines of a predefined size that has produced the highest number of progeny. These three selection approaches are put into practice in a simulation study where we demonstrate how the trade-off between sample size and sample quality affects the prediction accuracy of genomic prediction models for hybrid maize.},

Therefore, greater fluctuations could occur in urine than in blood, better reflecting the changes in human body. The roadmap of urine biomarker era was proposed. Although urine analysis has been attempted for clinical diagnosis, and urine has been monitored during the progression of many diseases, particularly urinary system diseases, whether urine can reflect brain disease status remains uncertain. As some biomarkers of brain diseases can be detected in the body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and blood, there is a possibility that urine also contain biomarkers of brain diseases. This review summarizes the clues of brain diseases reflected in the urine proteome and metabolome.},

abstract = {Life evolved on our planet by means of a combination of Darwinian selection and innovations leading to higher levels of complexity. The emergence and selection of replicating entities is a central problem in prebiotic evolution. Theoretical models have shown how populations of different types of replicating entities exclude or coexist with other classes of replicators. Models are typically kinetic, based on standard replicator equations. On the other hand, the presence of thermodynamical constraints for these systems remain an open question. This is largely due to the lack of a general theory of statistical methods for systems far from equilibrium. Nonetheless, a first approach to this problem has been put forward in a series of novel developements falling under the rubric of the extended second law of thermodynamics. The work presented here is twofold: firstly, we review this theoretical framework and provide a brief description of the three fundamental replicator types in prebiotic evolution: parabolic, malthusian and hyperbolic. Secondly, we employ these previously mentioned techinques to explore how replicators are constrained by thermodynamics. Finally, we comment and discuss where further research should be focused on.},

abstract = {The main theories of biodiversity either neglect species interactions or assume that species interact randomly with each other. However, recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly structured, and the lack of a theory that takes into account the structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields.},

abstract = {Biological networks, such as those describing gene regulation, signal transduction, and neural synapses, are representations of large-scale dynamic systems. Discovery of organizing principles of biological networks can be enhanced by embracing the notion that there is a deep interplay between network structure and system dynamics. Recently, many structural characteristics of these non-random networks have been identified, but dynamical implications of the features have not been explored comprehensively. We demonstrate by exhaustive computational analysis that a dynamical property--stability or robustness to small perturbations--is highly correlated with the relative abundance of small subnetworks (network motifs) in several previously determined biological networks. We propose that robust dynamical stability is an influential property that can determine the non-random structure of biological networks.},

abstract = {* Ecological network models based on aggregated data from species interactions are widely used to make inferences about species specialization, functionality and extinction risk. While increasing number of network data are available and are used in comparative studies, data quality and uncertainty have received little attention. Moreover, key individual-level information such as the proportion of individuals not involved in interactions and underlying processes driving interactions are ignored by aggregated data analysis. * We suggest an individual-level hierarchical interaction model as a more flexible approach to considering uncertainty, sampling effort and conditions under which interactions take place and from which network attributes can be derived. We performed a simulation exercise to compare inference under different sample sizes and from aggregated data matrices to those from our individual-level model. * Formalizing the process of network formation in an individual-level model made clear that per-species interaction frequencies are not independent of sample size and population pools and also ignore important information given by the proportion of non-interacting individuals. Hierarchical linear models are a possible solution to infer community-level attributes of network formation and allow various kinds of comprehensive model extensions to capture variation of per-individual interactions in space and time that shape upper level organization. * Individual-level hierarchical models provide the link between individual behaviour and interactions under variable environmental conditions and can be summarized into networks in a conceptually neat way. Such models may not only help to account for various sources of variation but also conceptualize aspects overlooked in aggregated data. In particular, the quantification of per-individual interactions under different sampling scenarios emphasizes that per-species interaction frequencies at the species level are not necessarily a surrogate of species abundance in natural systems under investigation},

FDRs distinguish between member of an enzyme family that are homofunctional (classified under the EC number of interest) or heterofunctional (annotated with another EC number or lacking enzymatic activity). Each of the two FDR-based components is associated to one of two specific kinds of enzyme families. EFICAz exhibits high precision performance, except when the maximal test to training sequence identity (MTTSI) is lower than 30{\%}.

We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {THE MOST WIDELY SPREAD MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, SUFFERS FROM A PARADOX: predictive models with a given level of accuracy may have greater predictive power than models with higher accuracy. Despite optimizing classification error rate, high accuracy models may fail to capture crucial information transfer in the classification task. We present evidence of this behavior by means of a combinatorial analysis where every possible contingency matrix of 2, 3 and 4 classes classifiers are depicted on the entropy triangle, a more reliable information-theoretic tool for classification assessment. Motivated by this, we develop from first principles a measure of classification performance that takes into consideration the information learned by classifiers. We are then able to obtain the entropy-modulated accuracy (EMA), a pessimistic estimate of the expected accuracy with the influence of the input distribution factored out, and the normalized information transfer factor (NIT), a measure of how efficient is the transmission of information from the input to the output set of classes. The EMA is a more natural measure of classification performance than accuracy when the heuristic to maximize is the transfer of information through the classifier instead of classification error count. The NIT factor measures the effectiveness of the learning process in classifiers and also makes it harder for them to "cheat" using techniques like specialization, while also promoting the interpretability of results. Their use is demonstrated in a mind reading task competition that aims at decoding the identity of a video stimulus based on magnetoencephalography recordings. We show how the EMA and the NIT factor reject rankings based in accuracy, choosing more meaningful and interpretable classifiers.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing has a crucial role in the generation of biological complexity, and its misregulation is often involved in human disease. Here we describe the assembly of a 'splicing code', which uses combinations of hundreds of RNA features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale.},

abstract = {We argue for expanding the role of theory in ecology to accelerate scientific progress, enhance the ability to address environmental challenges, foster the development of synthesis and unification, and improve the design of experiments and large-scale environmental-monitoring programs. To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.},

abstract = {Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encode proteins that recognize foreign antigens and are thus crucial for immune response. In a population of a single host species, parasite-mediated selection drives MHC allelic diversity. However, in a community-wide context, species interactions may modulate selection regimes because the prevalence of a given parasite in a given host may depend on its prevalence in other hosts. By combining network analysis with immunogenetics, we show that host species infected by similar parasites harbour similar alleles with similar frequencies. We further show, using a Bayesian approach, that the probability of mutual occurrence of a functional allele and a parasite in a given host individual is nonrandom and depends on other host-parasite interactions, driving co-evolution within subgroups of parasite species and functional alleles. Therefore, indirect effects among hosts and parasites can shape host MHC diversity, scaling it from the population to the community level.},

abstract = {NATURE | VOL 406 | 27 JULY 2000 | www.nature.com 379 called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web 3–5 , the Internet 6 , social networks 7 and cells 8 . We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by un-realistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks. The increasing availability of topological data on large networks, aided by the computerization of data acquisition, had led to great advances in our understanding of the generic aspects of network structure and development 9–16 . The existing empirical and theo-retical results indicate that complex networks can be divided into two major classes based on their connectivity distribution P(k), giving the probability that a node in the network is connected to k other nodes. The first class of networks is characterized by a P(k) that peaks at an average k and decays exponentially for large k. The most investigated examples of such exponential networks are the random graph model of Erd{\"{o}}s and R{\'{e}}nyi 9,10 and the small-world model of Watts and Strogatz 11},

We present a novel algorithm that incorporates SVD approximation into the EM procedure to reduce the overall computational cost while maintaining ac-curate predictions. Furthermore, we propose a new frame-work for collaborating filtering in distributed recommenda-tion systems that allows users to maintain their own rating profiles for privacy. A server periodically collects aggre-gate information from those users that are online to provide predictions for all users.

Previous computational methods in this domain have focused on either drug repositioning or matching drug and disease gene expression profiles. Here, we present a novel method for the large-scale prediction of drug indications (PREDICT) that can handle both approved drugs and novel molecules. Our method is based on the observation that similar drugs are indicated for similar diseases, and utilizes multiple drug-drug and disease-disease similarity measures for the prediction task. On cross-validation, it obtains high specificity and sensitivity (AUC=0.9) in predicting drug indications, surpassing existing methods. We validate our predictions by their overlap with drug indications that are currently under clinical trials, and by their agreement with tissue-specific expression information on the drug targets. We further show that disease-specific genetic signatures can be used to accurately predict drug indications for new diseases (AUC=0.92). This lays the computational foundation for future personalized drug treatments, where gene expression signatures from individual patients would replace the disease-specific signatures.},

abstract = {Given that various prey are available to fish in a particular ecosystem, by default fish feed selectively. Studies of fish feeding ecology have provided key insights into the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, yet prey selectivity is the least addressed component of these studies. This may be due to the higher level of effort associated with examining both the stomach contents and ambient prey abundance, the assumption that a determined diet composition is static, or the lack of a predictive protocol for a priori estimates of prey selectivity and diet composition. Here I present a rank proportion algorithm (RPA) model that predicts prey preference from first principles of predation that, when coupled with ambient prey concentrations, can predict prey utilization (i.e.. diet composition). I applied the model to benthivore, planktivore, and piscivore examples front lentic. lotic, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Compared with observed stomach contents, the RPA model's predictions of diet composition exhibited more than 83{\%} accuracy, and in most of the cases the model predicted the predominant prey item accurately; the entire prey rank order was predicted correctly on the order of 70-80{\%} of the time. Additionally, more than 85{\%} of the prey items were predicted to be within 10{\%} of observed values, and over 70{\%} were within 5{\%}. The results of the RPA model were notably different from those of the null model of no selectivity. The results Suggest that the RPA model is a useful tool when prey preference or stomach composition data are limited but required for other applications and that a general knowledge of the predation process is useful in obtaining quantitative information about fish diet.},

abstract = {A new trend in medicine is the use of algorithms to analyze big datasets, e.g. using everything your phone measures about you for diagnostics or monitoring. However, these algorithms are commonly compared against weak baselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an algorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with medically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the literature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find that the bulk of the literature ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}77{\%}) uses meaningless comparisons that ignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone data to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to over 80{\%} of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply guessing that each patient has their own average mood - the patient-specific baseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it usually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely useless. Comparing to the wrong (population) baseline has a massive effect on the perceived quality of algorithms and produces baseless optimism in the field. To solve this problem we propose "user lift" that reduces these systematic errors in the evaluation of personalized medical monitoring.},

abstract = {—Domain adaptation is one of the most challenging tasks of modern data analytics. If the adaptation is done correctly, models built on a specific data representation become more robust when confronted to data depicting the same classes, but described by another observation system. Among the many strategies proposed, finding domain-invariant representations has shown excellent properties, in particular since it allows to train a unique classifier effective in all domains. In this paper, we propose a regularized unsupervised optimal transportation model to perform the alignment of the representations in the source and target domains. We learn a transportation plan matching both PDFs, which constrains labeled samples of the same class in the source domain to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at the same time the labeled samples in the source and the distributions observed in both domains. Experiments on toy and challenging real visual adaptation examples show the interest of the method, that consistently outperforms state of the art approaches. In addition, numerical experiments show that our approach leads to better performances on domain invariant deep learning features and can be easily adapted to the semi-supervised case where few labeled samples are available in the target domain.},

abstract = {Graph kernels have emerged as a powerful tool for graph comparison. Most existing graph kernels focus on local properties of graphs and ignore global structure. In this paper, we compare graphs based on their global properties as these are captured by the eigenvectors of their adjacency matrices. We present two algorithms for both labeled and unlabeled graph comparison. These algorithms represent each graph as a set of vectors corresponding to the embeddings of its vertices. The similarity between two graphs is then determined using the Earth Mover's Distance metric. These similarities do not yield a positive semidefinite matrix. To address for this, we employ an algorithm for SVM classification using indefinite kernels. We also present a graph kernel based on the Pyramid Match kernel that finds an approximate correspondence between the sets of vectors of the two graphs. We further improve the proposed kernel using the Weisfeiler-Lehman framework. We evaluate the proposed methods on several benchmark datasets for graph classification and compare their performance to state-of-the-art graph kernels. In most cases, the proposed algorithms outperform the competing methods, while their time complexity remains very attractive.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental pertur-bations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutual-istic networks and host–parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

Many methods have been developed to this purpose but a comprehensive evaluation that covers unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised methods, and provides guidelines for their practical application, is lacking. We performed an extensive evaluation of inference methods on simulated and experimental expression data. The results reveal low prediction accuracies for unsupervised techniques with the notable exception of the Z-SCORE method on knockout data. In all other cases, the supervised approach achieved the highest accuracies and even in a semi-supervised setting with small numbers of only positive samples, outperformed the unsupervised techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA secondary structure prediction methods based on probabilistic modeling can be developed using stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs). Such methods can readily combine different sources of information that can be expressed probabilistically, such as an evolutionary model of comparative RNA sequence analysis and a biophysical model of structure plausibility. However, the number of free parameters in an integrated model for consensus RNA structure prediction can become untenable if the underlying SCFG design is too complex. Thus a key question is, what small, simple SCFG designs perform best for RNA secondary structure prediction? RESULTS: Nine different small SCFGs were implemented to explore the tradeoffs between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Each model was tested for single sequence structure prediction accuracy on a benchmark set of RNA secondary structures. CONCLUSIONS: Four SCFG designs had prediction accuracies near the performance of current energy minimization programs. One of these designs, introduced by Knudsen and Hein in their PFOLD algorithm, has only 21 free parameters and is significantly simpler than the others.},

In this paper, we introduce a local path index to estimate the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes. We propose a network model with controllable density and noise strength in generating links, as well as collect data of six real networks. Extensive numerical simulations on both modeled networks and real networks demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of the local path index compared with two well-known and widely used indices, the common neighbors and the Katz index. Indeed, the local path index provides competitively accurate predictions as the Katz index while requires much less CPU time and memory space, which is therefore a strong candidate for potential practical applications in data mining of huge-size networks.},

@article{Jiang2012,
abstract = {The direct "metagenomic" sequencing of genomic material from complex assemblages of bacteria, archaea, viruses and microeukaryotes has yielded new insights into the structure of microbial communities. For example, analysis of metagenomic data has revealed the existence of previously unknown microbial taxa whose spatial distributions are limited by environmental conditions, ecological competition, and dispersal mechanisms. However, differences in genotypes that might lead biologists to designate two microbes as taxonomically distinct need not necessarily imply differences in ecological function. Hence, there is a growing need for large-scale analysis of the distribution of microbial function across habitats. Here, we present a framework for investigating the biogeography of microbial function by analyzing the distribution of protein families inferred from environmental sequence data across a global collection of sites. We map over 6,000,000 protein sequences from unassembled reads from the Global Ocean Survey dataset to [Formula: see text] protein families, generating a protein family relative abundance matrix that describes the distribution of each protein family across sites. We then use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to approximate these protein family profiles as linear combinations of a small number of ecological components. Each component has a characteristic functional profile and site profile. Our approach identifies common functional signatures within several of the components. We use our method as a filter to estimate functional distance between sites, and find that an NMF-filtered measure of functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than a comparable PCA-filtered measure. We also find that functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than with geographic distance, in agreement with prior studies. We identify similar protein functions in several components and suggest that functional co-occurrence across metagenomic samples could lead to future methods for de-novo functional prediction. We conclude by discussing how NMF, and other dimension reduction methods, can help enable a macroscopic functional description of marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the development of synthetic gene networks has attracted much attention from many researchers. In particular, the genetic oscillator known as the repressilator has become a paradigm for how to design a gene network with a desired dynamic behaviour. Even though the repressilator can show oscillatory properties in its protein concentrations, their amplitudes, fre- quencies and phases are perturbed by the kinetic parametric fluctuations (intrinsic molecular perturbations) and external disturbances (extrinsic molecular noises) of the environment. Therefore, how to design a robust genetic oscillator with desired amplitude, frequency and phase under stochastic intrinsic and extrinsic molecular noises is an important topic for synthetic biology. In this study, based on periodic reference signals with arbitrary amplitudes, frequencies and phases, a robust synthetic gene oscillator is designed by tuning the kinetic parameters of repressilator via a genetic algorithm (GA) so that the protein concentrations can track the desired periodic reference signals under intrinsic and extrinsic molecular noises. GA is a stochastic optimization algorithm which was inspired by the mechanisms of natural selection and evolution genetics. By the proposed GA-based design algorithm, the repressila- tor can track the desired amplitude, frequency and phase of oscillation under intrinsic and extrinsic noises through the optimization of fitness function. The proposed GA-based design algorithm can mimic the natural selection in evolutionary process to select adequate kinetic param- eters for robust genetic oscillators. The design method can be easily extended to any synthetic gene network design with prescribed behaviours.},

@article{Law2010,
abstract = {Most approaches to classifying media content assume a fixed, closed vocabulary of labels. In contrast, we advocate machine learning approaches which take advantage of the millions of free-form tags obtainable via online crowd-sourcing platforms and social tagging websites. The use of such open vocabularies presents learning challenges due to typographical errors, synonymy, and a potentially unbounded set of tag labels. In this work, we present a new approach that organizes these noisy tags into well-behaved semantic classes using topic modeling, and learn to predict tags accurately using a mixture of topic classes. This method can utilize an arbitrary open vocabulary of tags, reduces training time by 94{\%} compared to learning from these tags directly, and achieves comparable performance for classification and superior performance for retrieval. We also demonstrate that on open vocabulary tasks, human evaluations are essential for measuring the true performance of tag classifiers, which traditional evaluation methods will consistently underestimate. We focus on the domain of tagging music clips, and demonstrate our results using data collected with a human computation game called TagATune. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Current clinical practices focus on a small number of biochemical directly related to the pathophysiology with patients and thus only describe a very limited metabolome of a patient and fail to consider the interations of these small molecules. This lack of extended information may prevent clinicians from making the best possible therapeutic interventions in sufficient time to improve patient care. Various post-genomics ‘('omic)' approaches have been used for therapeutic interventions previously. Metabolomics now a well-established'omics approach, has been widely adopted as a novel approach for biomarker discovery and in tandem with genomics (especially SNPs and GWAS) has the potential for providing systemic understanding of the underlying causes of pathology. In this review, we discuss the relevance of metabolomics approaches in clinical sciences and its potential for biomarker discovery which may help guide clinical interventions. Although a powerful and potentially high throughput approach for biomarker discovery at the molecular level, true translation of metabolomics into clinics is an extremely slow process. Quicker adaptation of biomarkers discovered using metabolomics can be possible with novel portable and wearable technologies aided by clever data mining, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence; we shall also discuss this with an eye to the future of precision medicine where metabolomics can be delivered to the masses.},

abstract = {Wasserstein Discriminant Analysis (WDA) is a new supervised method that can improve classification of high-dimensional data by computing a suitable linear map onto a lower dimensional subspace. Following the blueprint of classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), WDA selects the projection matrix that maximizes the ratio of two quantities: the dispersion of projected points coming from different classes, divided by the dispersion of projected points coming from the same class. To quantify dispersion, WDA uses regularized Wasserstein distances, rather than cross-variance measures which have been usually considered, notably in LDA. Thanks to the the underlying principles of optimal transport, WDA is able to capture both global (at distribution scale) and local (at samples scale) interactions between classes. Regularized Wasserstein distances can be computed using the Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm; We show that the optimization of WDA can be tackled using automatic differentiation of Sinkhorn iterations. Numerical experiments show promising results both in terms of prediction and visualization on toy examples and real life datasets such as MNIST and on deep features obtained from a subset of the Caltech dataset.},

We focus on machine learning-based approaches, particularly similarity-based methods that use drug and target similarities, which show relationships among drugs and those among targets, respectively. These two similarities represent two emerging concepts, the chemical space and the genomic space. Typically, the methods combine these two types of similarities to generate models for predicting new drug-target interactions. This process is also closely related to a lot of work in pharmacogenomics or chemical biology that attempt to understand the relationships between the chemical and genomic spaces. This background makes the similarity-based approaches attractive and promising. This article reviews the similarity-based machine learning methods for predicting drug-target interactions, which are state-of-the-art and have aroused great interest in bioinformatics.

abstract = {Recent attempts to examine the biological processes responsible for the general characteristics of mutualistic networks focus on two types of explanations: nonmatching biological attributes of species that prevent the occurrence of certain interactions ("forbidden links"), arising from trait complementarity in mutualist networks (as compared to barriers to exploitation in antagonistic ones), and random interactions among individuals that are proportional to their abundances in the observed community ("neutrality hypothesis"). We explored the consequences that simple linkage rules based on the first two hypotheses (complementarity of traits versus barriers to exploitation) had on the topology of plant-pollination networks. Independent of the linkage rules used, the inclusion of a small set of traits (two to four) sufficed to account for the complex topological patterns observed in real-world networks. Optimal performance was achieved by a "mixed model" that combined rules that link plants and pollinators whose trait ranges overlap ("complementarity models") and rules that link pollinators to flowers whose traits are below a pollinator-specific barrier value ("barrier models"). Deterrence of floral parasites (barrier model) is therefore at least as important as increasing pollination efficiency (complementarity model) in the evolutionary shaping of plant-pollinator networks.},

abstract = {Although networks provide a powerful approach to study a large variety of ecological systems, their formulation does not typically account for multiple interaction types, interactions that vary in space and time, and interconnected systems such as networks of networks. The emergent field of `multilayer networks' provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological systems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model `intralayer' and `interlayer' connectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous and related approaches, illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data, and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to further address ecological complexity, to ultimately provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.},

abstract = {An intricate network of interactions between organisms and their environment form the ecosystems that sustain life on earth. With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

The services are based on two proteochemometric models which accepts a protease or reverse transcriptase sequence in amino acid form, and outputs the predicted drug susceptibility values. The predictions are based on a comprehensive analysis where all the relevant inhibitors are included, resulting in models with excellent predictive capabilities. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The services are implemented as interoperable Web services (REST and XMPP), with supporting web pages to allow for individual analyses. A set of plugins were also developed which make the services available from the Bioclipse workbench for life science. Services are available at http://www.hivdrc.org/services.},

Commutative quasi-copulas allow to translate a general definition of fuzzy transitivity (when applied to reciprocal relations) elegantly into the framework of cycle-transitivity. Similarly, a general notion of stochastic transitivity corresponds to a particular class of upper bound functions. Ample attention is given to self-dual upper bound functions.},

abstract = {Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a powerful method for modeling data associated with pairwise relationships, finding use in collaborative filtering, computational biology, and document analysis, among other areas. In many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction. For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information. We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game are relevant for the outcome.},

abstract = {Production cycles in birds are proposed as prime cases of indirect interactions in food webs. They are thought to be driven by predators switching from rodents to bird nests in the crash phase of rodent population cycles. Although rodent cycles are geographically widespread and found in different rodent taxa, bird production cycles appear to be most profound in the high Arctic where lemmings dominate. We hypothesized that this may be due to arctic lemmings inducing stronger predator responses than boreal voles.We tested this hypothesis by estimating predation rates in dummy bird nests during a rodent cycle in low-Arctic tundra. Here, the rodent community consists of a spatially variable mix of one lemming (Lemmus lemmus) and two vole species (Myodes rufocanus and Microtus oeconomus) with similar abundances. In con- sistence with our hypothesis, lemming peak abundances predicted well crash-phase nest predation rates, whereas the vole abundances had no predic- tive ability. Corvids were found to be the most important nest predators. Lemmings appear to be accessible to the whole predator community which makes them particularly powerful drivers of food web dynamics.},

Beginning with Charles Elton's insights into food web structure, and continuing to contemporary ecologists and emerging areas of study, we highlight some of the most important empirical and theoretical advances made over the last century. The review highlights that there are fundamentally different ways in which food webs are depicted and studied. Specifically, when one views systems through mathematical, energy flow or functional lenses, very different perspectives on food web structure and dynamics emerge. The contributions of these scientists illustrate the considerable advances that the field has undergone, and they provide the foundation for expansive on-going research programs that fall under the broad umbrella of food web ecology.},

Owing to evolutionary conservation of the ATP-binding site, most kinase inhibitors that target this site promiscuously inhibit multiple kinases. Interpretation of experiments that use these compounds is confounded by a lack of data on the comprehensive kinase selectivity of most inhibitors. Here we used functional assays to profile the activity of 178 commercially available kinase inhibitors against a panel of 300 recombinant protein kinases. Quantitative analysis revealed complex and often unexpected interactions between protein kinases and kinase inhibitors, with a wide spectrum of promiscuity. Many off-target interactions occur with seemingly unrelated kinases, revealing how large-scale profiling can identify multitargeted inhibitors of specific, diverse kinases. The results have implications for drug development and provide a resource for selecting compounds to elucidate kinase function and for interpreting the results of experiments involving kinase inhibitors.},

Putative AK genes have now been identified in some eukaryotic microbes. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Phytophthora species, AK forms a pathway with PTA. AK has also been identified in non-yeast fungi but these fungi do not have PTA. Instead, AK forms a pathway with D-xylulose 5-phosphate phosphoketolase (XFP), a pathway that was also previously found only in bacteria. In Entamoeba histolytica, neither PTA nor XFP was found as a partner for AK. Thus, eukaryotic microbes seem to have incorporated the 'bacterial' enzyme AK into at least three different metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {Motivation: Analysis of organism-specific interactomes has yielded novel insights into cellular function and coordination, understanding of pathology, and identification of markers and drug targets. Genes, however, can exhibit varying levels of cell type specificity in their expression, and their coordinated expression manifests in tissue-specific function and pathology. Tissue-specific/tissue-selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug discovery, as they are more likely to reveal drug targets. Furthermore, tissue-specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly implicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and protein complexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology. These observations motivate the construction of refined tissue-specific interactomes from organism-specific interactomes.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults: We present a novel technique for constructing human tissue-specific interactomes. Using a variety of validation tests (Edge Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology Enrichment, Disease-Gene Subnetwork Compactness), we show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, using case studies of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, we show that tissue-specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct pathways implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in identifying novel targets.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nAvailability and implementation: http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/mohammas/projects/ActPro.html},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Classification of proteins sequences into functional and structural families based on sequence homology is a central problem in computational biology. Discriminative supervised machine learning approaches provide good performance, but simplicity and computational efficiency of training and prediction are also important concerns. RESULTS: We introduce a class of string kernels, called mismatch kernels, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to the problem of protein classification and remote homology detection. These kernels measure sequence similarity based on shared occurrences of fixed-length patterns in the data, allowing for mutations between patterns. Thus, the kernels provide a biologically well-motivated way to compare protein sequences without relying on family-based generative models such as hidden Markov models. We compute the kernels efficiently using a mismatch tree data structure, allowing us to calculate the contributions of all patterns occurring in the data in one pass while traversing the tree. When used with an SVM, the kernels enable fast prediction on test sequences. We report experiments on two benchmark SCOP datasets, where we show that the mismatch kernel used with an SVM classifier performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods for homology detection, particularly when very few training examples are available. Examination of the highest-weighted patterns learned by the SVM classifier recovers biologically important motifs in protein families and superfamilies.},

abstract = {Networks provide a natural representation of molecular biology knowledge, in particular to model relationships between biological entities such as genes, proteins, drugs, or diseases. Because of the effort, the cost, or the lack of the experiments necessary for the elucidation of these networks, computational approaches for network inference have been frequently investigated in the literature. In this paper, we examine the assessment of supervised network inference. Supervised inference is based on machine learning techniques that infer the network from a training sample of known interacting and possibly non-interacting entities and additional measurement data. While these methods are very effective, their reliable validation in silico poses a challenge, since both prediction and validation need to be performed on the basis of the same partially known network. Cross-validation techniques need to be specifically adapted to classification problems on pairs of objects. We perform a critical review and assessment of protocols and measures proposed in the literature and derive specific guidelines how to best exploit and evaluate machine learning techniques for network inference. Through theoretical considerations and in silico experiments, we analyze in depth how important factors influence the outcome of performance estimation. These factors include the amount of information available for the interacting entities, the sparsity and topology of biological networks, and the lack of experimentally verified non-interacting pairs.},

abstract = {Colicins are narrow-spectrum antibiotics produced by and active against Escherichia coli and its close relatives. Colicin-producing strains cannot coexist with sensitive or resistant strains in a well-mixed culture, yet all three phenotypes are recovered in natural populations. Recent in vitro results conclude that strain diversity can be promoted by colicin production in a spatially structured, non-transitive interaction, as in the classic non-transitive model rock-paper-scissors (RPS). In the colicin version of the RPS model, strains that produce colicins (C) kill sensitive (S) strains, which outcompete resistant (R) strains, which outcompete C strains. Pairwise in vitro competitions between these three strains are resolved in a predictable order (C beats S, S beats R, and R beats C), but the complete system of three strains presents the opportunity for dynamic equilibrium. Here we provide conclusive evidence of an in vivo antagonistic role for colicins and show that colicins (and potentially other bacteriocins) may promote, rather than eliminate, microbial diversity in the environment.},

This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention to Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful framework, but additionally present a wide range of methods that have recently emerged as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric learning, similarity learning and local metric learning. Recent trends and extensions, such as semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for histogram data and the derivation of generalization guarantees, are also covered. Finally, this survey addresses metric learning for structured data, in particular edit distance learning, and attempts to give an overview of the remaining challenges in metric learning for the years to come.},

abstract = {The pressing need to conserve and restore habitats in the face of ongoing species loss [1, 2] requires a better understanding of what happens to communities when species are lost or reinstated [3, 4]. Theoretical models show that communities are relatively insensitive to species loss [5, 6]; however, they disagree with field manipulations showing a cascade of extinctions [7, 8] and have seldom been tested under field conditions (e.g., [9]). We experimentally removed the most abundant seed-dispersing ant species from seed dispersal networks in a Mediterranean landscape, replicating the experiment in three types of habitat, and then compared these communities to un-manipulated control communities. Removal did not result in large-scale changes in network structure. It revealed extensive structural plasticity of the remaining community, which rearranged itself through rewiring, while maintaining its functionality. The remaining ant species widened their diet breadth in a way that maintained seed dispersal, despite the identity of many interactions changing. The species interaction strength decreased; thus, the importance of each ant species for seed dispersal became more homogeneous, thereby reducing the dependence of seed species on one dominant ant species. Compared to the experimental results, a simulation model that included rewiring considerably overestimated the effect of species loss on network robustness. If community-level species loss models are to be of practical use in ecology or conservation, they need to include behavioral and population responses, and they need to be routinely tested under field conditions; doing this would be to the advantage of both empiricists and theoreticians.},

Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.},

Currently PPI networks for individuals are not available, but gene expression data is becoming easier to obtain and allows us to represent individuals by a co-integrated gene expression/protein interaction network. Two major problems hamper the application of graph kernels - state-of-the-art methods for whole-graph comparison - to compare PPI networks. First, these methods do not scale to graphs of the size of a PPI network. Second, missing edges in these interaction networks are biologically relevant for detecting discrepancies, yet, these methods do not take this into account. In this article we present graph kernels for biological network comparison that are fast to compute and take into account missing interactions. We evaluate their practical performance on two datasets of co-integrated gene expression/PPI networks.},

abstract = {In principle, zero-shot learning makes it possible to train a recognition model simply by specifying the category's attributes. For example, with classifiers for generic attributes like $\backslash$emph{\{}striped{\}} and $\backslash$emph{\{}four-legged{\}}, one can construct a classifier for the zebra category by enumerating which properties it possesses---even without providing zebra training images. In practice, however, the standard zero-shot paradigm suffers because attribute predictions in novel images are hard to get right. We propose a novel random forest approach to train zero-shot models that explicitly accounts for the unreliability of attribute predictions. By leveraging statistics about each attribute's error tendencies, our method obtains more robust discriminative models for the unseen classes. We further devise extensions to handle the few-shot scenario and unreliable attribute descriptions. On three datasets, we demonstrate the benefit for visual category learning with zero or few training examples, a critical domain for rare categories or categories defined on the fly.},

abstract = {Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection.},

abstract = {The concept of multiple graph alignment (MGA) has recently been introduced as a novel method for the structural analysis of biomolecules. Using approximate graph matching techniques, this method enables the robust identification of approximately conserved patterns in biologically related structures. In particular, MGA enables the characterization of functional protein families independent of sequence or fold homology. This article first recalls the concept of MGA and then addresses the problem of computing optimal alignments from an algorithmic point of view. In this regard, a method from the field of evolutionary algorithms is proposed and empirically compared with a hitherto existing heuristic approach. Empirically, it is shown that the former yields significantly better results than the latter, albeit at the cost of an increased runtime.},

abstract = {Deciphering the network of protein interactions that underlines cellular operations has become one of the main tasks of proteomics and computational biology. Recently, a set of bioinformatics approaches has emerged for the prediction of possible interactions by combining sequence and genomic information. Even though the initial results are very promising, the current methods are still far from perfect. We propose here a new way of discovering possible protein-protein interactions based on the comparison of the evolutionary distances between the sequences of the associated protein families, an idea based on previous observations of correspondence between the phylogenetic trees of associated proteins in systems such as ligands and receptors. Here, we extend the approach to different test sets, including the statistical evaluation of their capacity to predict protein interactions. To demonstrate the possibilities of the system to perform large-scale predictions of interactions, we present the application to a collection of more than 67 000 pairs of E.coli proteins, of which 2742 are predicted to correspond to interacting proteins.},

abstract = {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory. This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional statistical methods, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters, allowing the construction of a 'synthetic likelihood' that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson's classic blowfly experiments.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Sampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases, and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* While the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of interactions Imax among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e., Imax = AP) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, i.e., life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically I {\textless}{\textless} Imax, resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to species inventories, a sizable fraction of non-observed pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological constraints that forbid their occurrence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Reasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches, and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the unobserved links when addressing sampling effort.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Recent implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or for individual-based data can be combined with the assessment of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic estimate of interaction richness in a robustly-sampled assemblage and the maximum richness Imax of interactions. This is crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of defaunationdriven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {The smallest eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors (i.e., eigenpairs) of a graph Laplacian matrix have been widely used in spectral clustering and community detection. However, in real-life applications the number of clusters or communities (say, {\$}K{\$}) is generally unknown a-priori. Consequently, the majority of the existing methods either choose {\$}K{\$} heuristically or they repeat the clustering method with different choices of {\$}K{\$} and accept the best clustering result. The first option, more often, yields suboptimal result, while the second option is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose an incremental method for constructing the eigenspectrum of the graph Laplacian matrix. This method leverages the eigenstructure of graph Laplacian matrix to obtain the {\$}K{\$}-th smallest eigenpair of the Laplacian matrix given a collection of all previously computed {\$}K-1{\$} smallest eigenpairs. Our proposed method adapts the Laplacian matrix such that the batch eigenvalue decomposition problem transforms into an efficient sequential leading eigenpair computation problem. As a practical application, we consider user-guided spectral clustering. Specifically, we demonstrate that users can utilize the proposed incremental method for effective eigenpair computation and for determining the desired number of clusters based on multiple clustering metrics.},

abstract = {The objective in extreme multi-label classification is to learn a classifier that can automatically tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a large label set. Extreme multi-label classification is an important research problem since not only does it enable the tackling of applications with many labels but it also allows the reformulation of ranking problems with certain advantages over existing formulations. Our objective, in this paper, is to develop an extreme multi-label classifier that is faster to train and more accu-rate at prediction than the state-of-the-art Multi-label Ran-dom Forest (MLRF) algorithm [2] and the Label Partition-ing for Sub-linear Ranking (LPSR) algorithm [35]. MLRF and LPSR learn a hierarchy to deal with the large num-ber of labels but optimize task independent measures, such as the Gini index or clustering error, in order to learn the hierarchy. Our proposed FastXML algorithm achieves sig-nificantly higher accuracies by directly optimizing an nDCG based ranking loss function. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm for efficiently optimizing the pro-posed formulation. Experiments reveal that FastXML can be trained on problems with more than a million labels on a standard desktop in eight hours using a single core and in an hour using multiple cores.},

In anticipation of this milestone, the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) launched the Project to Annotate 1000 Genomes. The project is built around the principle that the key to improved accuracy in high-throughput annotation technology is to have experts annotate single subsystems over the complete collection of genomes, rather than having an annotation expert attempt to annotate all of the genes in a single genome. Using the subsystems approach, all of the genes implementing the subsystem are analyzed by an expert in that subsystem. An annotation environment was created where populated subsystems are curated and projected to new genomes. A portable notion of a populated subsystem was defined, and tools developed for exchanging and curating these objects. Tools were also developed to resolve conflicts between populated subsystems. The SEED is the first annotation environment that supports this model of annotation. Here, we describe the subsystem approach, and offer the first release of our growing library of populated subsystems. The initial release of data includes 180 177 distinct proteins with 2133 distinct functional roles. This data comes from 173 subsystems and 383 different organisms.},

We extend this framework by incorporating a novel similarity measurement, which allows for the representation of much more complex data structures. The proposed framework also enables us to exploit additional information (e.g., the input-dependent features) by constructing the covariance matrices with combining them on the covariance function.

abstract = {In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modification of community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time. The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of $\beta$-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up $\beta$-diversity of community composition to the $\beta$-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new ordination method to compare several communities containing species that differ according to their taxonomic, morphological or biological features. The objective is first to find dissimilarities among communities from the knowledge about differences among their species, and second to describe these dissimilarities with regard to the feature diversity within communities. In 1986, Rao initiated a general framework for analysing the extent of the diversity. He defined a diversity coefficient called quadratic entropy and a dissimilarity coefficient and proposed a decomposition of this diversity coefficient in a way similar to ANOVA. Furthermore, Gower and Legendre (1986) built a weighted principal coordinate analysis. Using the previous context, we propose a new method called the double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA) to analyse the relation between two kinds of data. The first contains differences among species (dissimilarity matrix); the second the species distribution among communities (abundance or presence/absence matrix). A multidimensional space assembling the species points and the community points is built. The species points define the original differences between species and the community points define the deduced differences between communities. Furthermore, this multidimensional space is linked with the diversity decomposition into between-community and within-community diversities. One looks for axes that provide a graphical ordination of the communities and project the species onto them. An illustration is proposed comparing bird communities which live in different areas under mediterranean bioclimates. Compared to some existing methods, the double principal coordinate analysis can provide a typology of communities taking account of an abundance matrix and can include dissimilarities among species. Finally, we show that such an approach generalizes some of these methods and allows us to develop new analyses. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Isbell2015,
abstract = {It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide1 . Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities2 . However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results3–13. Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50{\%} during climate events, whereas that of highdiversity communities with 16–32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25{\%}. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivitydependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability14, and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.},

abstract = {Inpainting, the technique of modifying an image in an undetectable form, is as ancient as art itself. The goals and applications of in- painting are numerous, from the restoration of damaged paintings and photographs to the removal/replacement of selected objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for digital inpainting of still images that attempts to replicate the basic techniques used by professional restorators. After the user selects the regions to be restored, the algorithm automatically fills-in these regions with in- formation surrounding them. The fill-in is done in such a way that isophote lines arriving at the regions' boundaries are completed in- side. In contrast with previous approaches, the technique here in- troduced does not require the user to specify where the novel in- formation comes from. This is automatically done (and in a fast way), thereby allowing to simultaneously fill-in numerous regions containing completely different structures and surrounding back- grounds. In addition, no limitations are imposed on the topology of the region to be inpainted. Applications of this technique include the restoration of old photographs and damaged film; removal of su- perimposed text like dates, subtitles, or publicity; and the removal of entire objects from the image like microphones or wires in spe- cial effects.},

abstract = {Biological networks change dynamically as protein components are synthesized and degraded. Understanding the time-dependence and, in a multicellular organism, tissue-dependence of a network leads to insight beyond a view that collapses time-varying interactions into a single static map. Conventional algorithms are limited to analyzing evolving networks by reducing them to a series of unrelated snapshots.Here we introduce an approach that groups proteins according to shared interaction patterns through a dynamical hierarchical stochastic block model. Protein membership in a block is permitted to evolve as interaction patterns shift over time and space, representing the spatial organization of cell types in a multicellular organism. The spatiotemporal evolution of the protein components are inferred from transcript profiles, using Arabidopsis root development (5 tissues, 3 temporal stages) as an example.The new model requires essentially no parameter tuning, out-performs existing snapshot-based methods, identifies protein modules recruited to specific cell types and developmental stages, and could have broad application to social networks and other similar dynamic systems.},

abstract = {Bacteriophages play key roles in microbial evolution1,2, marine nutrient cycling3 and human disease4. Phages are genetically diverse, and their genome architectures are characteristically mosaic, driven by horizontal gene transfer with other phages and host genomes5. As a consequence, phage evolution is complex and their genomes are composed of genes with distinct and varied evolutionary histories6,7. However, there are conflicting perspectives on the roles of mosaicism and the extent to which it generates a spectrum of genome diversity8 or genetically discrete populations9,10. Here, we show that bacteriophages evolve within two general evolutionary modes that differ in the extent of horizontal gene transfer by an order of magnitude. Temperate phages distribute into high and low gene flux modes, whereas lytic phages share only the lower gene flux mode. The evolutionary modes are also a function of the bacterial host and different proportions of temperate and lytic phages are distributed in either mode depending on the host phylum. Groups of genetically related phages fall into either the high or low gene flux modes, suggesting there are genetic as well as ecological drivers of horizontal gene transfer rates. Consequently, genome mosaicism varies depending on the host, lifestyle and genetic constitution of phages.},

abstract = {Nutritional mutualisms are ancient, widespread, and profoundly influential in biological communi- ties and ecosystems. Although much is known about these interactions, comprehensive answers to fundamental questions, such as how resource availability and structured interactions influence mutualism persistence, are still lacking. Mathematical modelling of nutritional mutualisms has great potential to facilitate the search for comprehensive answers to these and other fundamental questions by connecting the physiological and genomic underpinnings of mutualisms with ecologi- cal and evolutionary processes. In particular, when integrated with empirical data, models enable understanding of underlying mechanisms and generalisation of principles beyond the particulars of a given system. Here, we demonstrate how mathematical models can be integrated with data to address questions of mutualism persistence at four biological scales: cell, individual, population, and community. We highlight select studies where data has been or could be integrated with mod- els to either inform model structure or test model predictions. We also point out opportunities to increase model rigour through tighter integration with data, and describe areas in which data is urgently needed. We focus on plant-microbe systems, for which a wealth of empirical data is available, but the principles and approaches can be generally applied to any nutritional mutualism.},

abstract = {Living organisms function in accordance with complex mechanisms that operate in different ways depending on conditions. Darwin's theory of evolution suggests that such mechanisms evolved through variation guided by natural selection. However, there has existed no theory thatwould explain quantitatively which mechanisms can so evolve in realistic population sizes within realistic time periods, and which are too complex. In this article, we suggest such a theory. We treat Darwinian evolution as a form of computational learning from examples in which the course of learning is influenced only by the aggregate fitness of the hypotheses on the examples, and not otherwise by specific examples.We formulate a notion of evolvability that distinguishes function classes that are evolvable with polynomially bounded resources from those that are not. We show that in a single stage of evolution monotone Boolean conjunctions and disjunctions are evolvable over the uniform distribution, while Boolean parity functions are not. We suggest that the mechanism that underlies biological evolution overall is “evolvable target pursuit”, which consists of a series of evolutionary stages, each one inexorably pursuing an evolvable target in the technical sense suggested above, each such target being rendered evolvable by the serendipitous combination of the environment and the outcomes of previous evolutionary stages.

abstract = {Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the cor- ruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying data- generating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corrup- tion process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justifi- cation which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty). 1},

abstract = {Current evidence demonstrates that a sixth major extinction of biological diversity event is underway.1. The Earth is losing between one and ten percent of biodiversity per decade2, mostly due to habitat loss, pest invasion, pollution, over-harvesting and disease3. Certain natural ecosystem services are vital for human societies. Many fruit, nut, vegetable, legume, and seed crops depend on pollination. Pollination services are provided both by wild, free-living organisms (mainly bees, but also to name a few many butterflies, moths and flies), and by commercially managed bee species. Bees are the predominant and most economically important group of pollinators in most geographical regions. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)4 estimates that out of some 100 crop species which provide 90{\%} of food worldwide, 71 of these are bee-pollinated. In Europe alone, 84{\%} of the 264 crop species are animal- pollinated and 4 000 vegetable varieties exist thanks to pollination by bees5. The production value of one tonne of pollinator-dependent crop is approximately five times higher than one of those crop categories that do not depend on insects6. Has a “pollinator crisis” really been occurring during recent decades, or are these concerns just another sign of global biodiversity decline? Several studies have highlighted different factors leading to the pollinators' decline that have been observed around the world. This bulletin considers the latest scientific findings and analyses possible answers to this question. As the bee group is the most important pollinator worldwide, this bulletin focuses on the instability of wild and managed bee populations, the driving forces, potential mitigating measures and recommendations.},

Information about the submitochondria location for a mitochondria protein can provide much better understanding about its function. We use ten representative models of protein samples such as pseudo amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, functional domain composition, the combining discrete model based on prediction of solvent accessibility and secondary structure elements, the discrete model of pairwise sequence similarity, etc. We construct a predictor based on support vector machines (SVMs) for each representative model. The overall prediction accuracy by the leave-one-out cross validation test obtained by the predictor which is based on the discrete model of pairwise sequence similarity is 1{\%} better than the best computational system that exists for this problem. Moreover, we develop a method based on ordered weighted averaging (OWA) which is one of the fusion data operators. Therefore, OWA is applied on the 11 best SVM-based classifiers that are constructed based on various features of sequence. This method is called Mito-Loc. The overall leave-one-out cross validation accuracy obtained by Mito-Loc is about 95{\%}. This indicates that our proposed approach (Mito-Loc) is superior to the result of the best existing approach which has already been reported.},

Here we introduce the 'Curveball algorithm', a new procedure that differs from existing methods in that it focuses rather on matrix information content than on matrix structure. We demonstrate that the algorithm can sample uniformly the set of all possible matrix configurations requiring a computational effort orders of magnitude lower than that required by available methods, making it possible to easily randomize matrices larger than 10(8) cells.},

@article{Llaneras2008,
abstract = {There are several methodologies based on representations of cell metabolism that share two characteristics: the use of a metabolic network and the assumption of pseudosteady state. These methodologies have different purposes, employ different mathematical tools and are based on different assumptions; however, they all exploit the properties of a similar mathematical description. In this article we use the term stoichiometric modelling to encompass all these methodologies and to describe them within a common framework. Although the information about reaction stoichiometry embedded in metabolic networks is highly important, the framework encompasses methodologies not limited to the use of stoichiometric information. To highlight this fact, the definition of the framework is approached from a constraint-based perspective. One of the reasons for the success of stoichiometric modelling is that it avoids the difficulties that arise in the development of kinetic models: a consequence of the lack of intracellular experimental measurements. Thus, it makes it possible to exploit the knowledge about the structure of cell metabolism, without considering the still not very well known intracellular kinetic processes. Stoichiometric models have been used to estimate the metabolic flux distribution under given circumstances in the cell at some given moment (metabolic flux analysis), to predict it on the basis of some optimality hypothesis (flux balance analysis), and as tools for the structural analysis of metabolism providing information about systemic characteristics of the cell under investigation (network-based pathway analysis).},

However, only a tiny portion of all drug-target pairs in current datasets are experimentally validated interactions. This motivates the need for developing computational methods that predict true interaction pairs with high accuracy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show that a simple machine learning method that uses the drug-target network as the only source of information is capable of predicting true interaction pairs with high accuracy. Specifically, we introduce interaction profiles of drugs (and of targets) in a network, which are binary vectors specifying the presence or absence of interaction with every target (drug) in that network. We define a kernel on these profiles, called the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel, and use a simple classifier, (kernel) Regularized Least Squares (RLS), for prediction drug-target interactions. We test comparatively the effectiveness of RLS with the GIP kernel on four drug-target interaction networks used in previous studies. The proposed algorithm achieves area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) up to 92.7, significantly improving over results of state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we show that using also kernels based on chemical and genomic information further increases accuracy, with a neat improvement on small datasets. These results substantiate the relevance of the network topology (in the form of interaction profiles) as source of information for predicting drug-target interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Software and Supplementary Material are available at http://cs.ru.nl/{\~{}}tvanlaarhoven/drugtarget2011/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: tvanlaarhoven@cs.ru.nl; elenam@cs.ru.nl.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we call for the integration of niche and network theories to reach new frontiers of knowledge exploring how interactions within and across trophic levels promote species coexistence. This integration is possible due to the strong parallelisms in the historical development, ecological concepts, and associated mathematical tools of both theories.

abstract = {A central problem in computational metabolic modelling is how to find biochemically plausible pathways between metabolites in a metabolic network. Two general, complementary frameworks have been utilized to find metabolic pathways: constraint-based modelling and graph-theoretical path finding approaches. In constraint-based modelling, one aims to find pathways where metabolites are balanced in a pseudo steady-state. Constraint-based methods, such as elementary flux mode analysis, have typically a high computational cost stemming from a large number of steady-state pathways in a typical metabolic network. On the other hand, graph-theoretical approaches avoid the computational complexity of constraint-based methods by solving a simpler problem of finding shortest paths. However, while scaling well with network size, graph-theoretic methods generally tend to return more false positive pathways than constraint-based methods.},

abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) has shown excellent performance in a variety of machine learning tasks. This manuscript presents Deep Convolutional Neural Fields (DeepCNF), a combination of DCNN with Conditional Random Field (CRF), for sequence labeling with highly imbalanced label distribution. The widely-used training methods, such as maximum-likelihood and maximum labelwise accuracy, do not work well on highly imbalanced data. To handle this, we present a new training algorithm called maximum-AUC for DeepCNF. That is, we train DeepCNF by directly maximizing the empirical Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), which is an unbiased measurement for imbalanced data. To fulfill this, we formulate AUC in a pairwise ranking framework, approximate it by a polynomial function and then apply a gradient-based procedure to optimize it. We then test our AUC-maximized DeepCNF on three very different protein sequence labeling tasks: solvent accessibility prediction, 8-state secondary structure prediction, and disorder prediction. Our experimental results confirm that maximum-AUC greatly outperforms the other two training methods on 8-state secondary structure prediction and disorder prediction since their label distributions are highly imbalanced and also have similar performance as the other two training methods on the solvent accessibility prediction problem which has three equally-distributed labels. Furthermore, our experimental results also show that our AUC-trained DeepCNF models greatly outperform existing popular predictors of these three tasks.},

An important task when working with sets of networks is network comparison, developing a similarity or distance measure between networks so that meaningful comparisons can be drawn. The best means to accomplish this task remains an open area of research. Here we introduce a new measure to compare networks, the Portrait Divergence, that is mathematically principled, incorporates the topological characteristics of networks at all structural scales, and is general-purpose and applicable to all types of networks. An important feature of our measure that enables many of its useful properties is that it is based on a graph invariant, the network portrait. We test our measure on both synthetic graphs and real world networks taken from protein interaction data, neuroscience, and computational social science applications. The Portrait Divergence reveals important characteristics of multilayer and temporal networks extracted from data.},

abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learn-ing invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and applica-tion of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

abstract = {If the observed properties of food webs vary with the completeness of the data on which they are based, then the incompleteness of most collected webs may mislead us about their actual properties. Using a large, moderately well-known web, we simulated ecologists' efforts to detect member species and links between them at a variety of sampling intensities, and then we analyzed the effects of sampling intensity on a large number of properties of the resulting webs. Four striking points emerged. First, the properties of this single web vary markedly with the intensity of sampling: incompleteness of data can strongly bias estimates of food-web properties. Second, the original values are reached only after a high level of sampling, much higher than is typical for many studies. Third, the properties of most webs in the ECOWeB database lie at the poorly sampled end of the ranges. Fourth, the detection of trophic links systematically lags behind the detection and inclusion of species, which may render the accurate measurement of many web properties inherently problematic. These results suggest that both the incompleteness of the existing data and our focus on properties that are sensitive to that incompleteness may be giving us a misleading picture of the trophic structure of ecological communities.},

We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance over classical optimal transportation distances on the MNIST benchmark problem.},

abstract = {Link prediction plays an important role in multiple areas of artificial intelligence, including social network analysis and bioinformatics; however, it is often negatively affected by the data sparsity problem. In this paper, we present and validate our hypothesis, i.e., for sparse networks, incidence matrix factorization (IMF) could perform bet-ter than adjacency matrix factorization (AMF), the latter used in many previous studies. A key observation supporting our hypothesis here is that IMF models a partially observed graph more accurately than AMF. Unfortunately, a tech-nical challenge we face in validating our hypothesis is that there is not an obvious method for making link prediction using a factorized incidence matrix, unlike the AMF approach. To this end, we developed an optimization-based link prediction method. Then we have conducted thorough experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets to investigate the relationship between the sparsity of a network and the predictive performance of the aforementioned two factorization approaches. Our experimental results show that IMF performed better than AMF as networks became sparser, which validates our hypothesis.},

@article{Olito2015,
abstract = {Plant – pollinator mutualistic networks represent the ecological context of foraging (for pollinators) and reproduction (for plants and some pollinators). Plant – pollinator visitation networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats and species assemblages. Th e most successful hypotheses to explain these network properties are the neutrality and biological constraints hypotheses, which posit that species interaction frequencies can be explained by species relative abundances, and trait mismatches between potential mutualists respectively. However, previous network analyses emphasize the prediction of metrics of qualitative network structure, which may not represent stringent tests of these hypotheses. Using a newly documented temporally explicit alpine plant – pollinator visitation network, we show that metrics of both qualitative and quantitative network structure are easy to predict, even by models that predict the identity or frequency of species interactions poorly. A variety of phenological and morphological constraints as well as neutral interactions successfully predicted all network metrics tested, without accurately predicting species observed interactions. Species phenology alone was the best predictor of observed interaction frequencies. However, all models were poor predic-tors of species pairwise interaction frequencies, suggesting that other aspects of species biology not generally considered in network studies, such as reproduction for dipterans, play an important role in shaping plant – pollinator visitation network structure at this site. Future progress in explaining the structure and dynamics of mutualistic networks will require new approaches that emphasize accurate prediction of species pairwise interactions rather than network metrics, and better refl ect the biology underlying species interactions. Mutualistic interactions between plants and their animal pollinators exhibit tremendous diversity in their nature and specifi city, ranging from highly specialized species pairings to indiscriminate generalists (Jordano 1987, Waser et al. 1996). At the community level, this variation emerges as a network of mutualistic interactions specifying both who pollinates whom, and who provides food resources for whom. Studies of pollination interaction networks have increasingly focused on identifying causal links between species ' traits and the detailed structure of species interactions in order to predict the ecological and evolutionary dynam-ics of plants and their animal pollinators (Strauss and Irwin 2004, V {\'{a}} zquez et al. 2009a, Junker et al. 2010, 2013). Pollination interaction networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats, species assem-blages, and time (Jordano et al. 2003, V {\'{a}} zquez et al. 2009a). Interaction networks are sparse (a small fraction of all possible interactions are actually observed, i.e. connectance is low), nested (specialized species tend to interact with a proper subset of the species with which generalists interact), exhibit skewed ' degree distributions ' (most plants are pollinated by only a few pollinators, and most pollinators pollinate only a few plants), and species are signifi cantly more specialized than expected given the availability of potential mutualistic partners (Jordano et al. 2003, Bl {\"{u}} thgen et al. 2008, Dupont et al. 2009). Th e generality of these network structural prop-erties suggests general underlying mechanisms (Jordano et al. 2003), and recent network studies have emphasized the need to test putative determinants of network structure, such as species traits and abundances (V {\'{a}} zquez et al. 2007, 2009b). Several hypotheses for underlying determinants of network structure have been supported by empirical and theoretical work, the most successful of which are the neu-trality and biological constraints hypotheses. Under the neutrality hypothesis, species interact randomly, resulting in interaction frequencies proportional to relative species abundances (V {\'{a}} zquez and Aizen 2004, Canard et al. 2014). Th e biological constraints hypothesis posits that constraints imposed through trait mismatches between potential mutu-alists strongly infl uence network structure (Jordano et al. 2003, Santamaria and Rodriguez-Girones 2007). It is important to note that both neutral and trait-based mod-els constrain predicted network structure by identifying interactions that are impossible or unlikely due to low local abundances, trait mis-matches, or both. Studies that have evaluated both hypotheses suggest that metrics of network structure like connectance and nestedness are best predicted by a combination of neutral interactions and various biological},

We use 121 data sets, which represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large-scale problems) and other own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behavior, not dependent on the data set col-lection. The classifiers most likely to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1{\%} of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90{\%} in the 84.3{\%} of the data sets. However, the dif-ference is not statistically significant with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM, which achieves 92.3{\%} of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package). The random forest is clearly the best family of classifiers (3 out of 5 bests classifiers are RF), followed by SVM (4 classifiers in the top-10), neural networks and boosting ensembles (5 and 3 members in the top-20, respectively).},

abstract = {One of the central aims of ecology is to identify mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. Numerous theoretical models have shown that competing species can coexist if ecological processes such as dispersal, movement, and interaction occur over small spatial scales. In particular, this may be the case for non-transitive communities, that is, those without strict competitive hierarchies. The classic non-transitive system involves a community of three competing species satisfying a relationship similar to the children's game rock-paper-scissors, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems. Some models predict that local interaction and dispersal are sufficient to ensure coexistence of all three species in such a community, whereas diversity is lost when ecological processes occur over larger scales. Here, we test these predictions empirically using a non-transitive model community containing three populations of Escherichia coli. We find that diversity is rapidly lost in our experimental community when dispersal and interaction occur over relatively large spatial scales, whereas all populations coexist when ecological processes are localized.},

abstract = {Despite the traditional focus of network science on static networks, most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links. By disrupting the paths, link temporality has been shown to frustrate many dynamical processes on networks, from information spreading to accessibility. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we must ask: Are there any advantages of the networks' temporality? Here we develop an analytical framework to explore the control properties of temporal networks, arriving at the counterintuitive conclusion that temporal networks, compared to their static (i.e. aggregated) counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and the control trajectories, through which the system reaches its final states, are significantly more compact than those characterizing their static counterparts. The combination of analytical, numerical and empirical results demonstrates that temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, significantly enhancing our ability to control them.},

abstract = {Enzyme function prediction problem is usually solved using annotation transfer methods. These methods are suitable in cases where the function of the new protein is previously characterized and included in the taxonomy such as EC hierarchy. However, given a new function that is not previously described, these approaches arguably do not offer adequate support for the human expert. In this paper, we explore a structured output learning approach, where enzyme function—an enzymatic reaction—is described in fine-grained fashion with so called reaction kernels which allow interpolation and extrapolation in the output (reaction) space. Two structured output models are learned via Kernel Density Estimation and Maximum Margin Regression to predict enzymatic reactions from sequence motifs. We bring forward two choices for constructing reaction kernels and experiment with them in the remote homology case where the functions in the test set have not been seen in the training phase. Our experiments demonstrate the viability of our approach.},

abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

The biological consequences of multi-kinase activity are poorly defined, and an important step toward understanding the relationship between selectivity, efficacy and safety is the exploration of how inhibitors interact with the human kinome. We present interaction maps for 38 kinase inhibitors across a panel of 317 kinases representing {\textgreater}50{\%} of the predicted human protein kinome. The data constitute the most comprehensive study of kinase inhibitor selectivity to date and reveal a wide diversity of interaction patterns. To enable a global analysis of the results, we introduce the concept of a selectivity score as a general tool to quantify and differentiate the observed interaction patterns. We further investigate the impact of panel size and find that small assay panels do not provide a robust measure of selectivity.},

abstract = {Protein interactions play a vital part in the function of a cell. As experimental techniques for detection and validation of protein interactions are time consuming, there is a need for computational methods for this task. Protein interactions appear to form a network with a relatively high degree of local clustering. In this paper we exploit this clustering by suggesting a score based on triplets of observed protein interactions. The score utilises both protein characteristics and network properties. Our score based on triplets is shown to complement existing techniques for predicting protein interactions, outperforming them on data sets which display a high degree of clustering. The predicted interactions score highly against test measures for accuracy. Compared to a similar score derived from pairwise interactions only, the triplet score displays higher sensitivity and specificity. By looking at specific examples, we show how an experimental set of interactions can be enriched and validated. As part of this work we also examine the effect of different prior databases upon the accuracy of prediction and find that the interactions from the same kingdom give better results than from across kingdoms, suggesting that there may be fundamental differences between the networks. These results all emphasize that network structure is important and helps in the accurate prediction of protein interactions. The protein interaction data set and the program used in our analysis, and a list of predictions and validations, are available at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/bioinfo/resources/PredictingInteractions.},

Finally, we propose a novel approach to address the class imbalance problem which is common in link prediction by directly optimizing for a ranking loss. Our model is optimized with stochastic gradient descent and scales to large graphs. Results on several datasets show the efficacy of our approach.},

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The bacteriophage population is large, dynamic, ancient, and genetically diverse. Limited genomic information shows that phage genomes are mosaic, and the genetic architecture of phage populations remains ill-defined. To understand the population structure of phages infecting a single host strain, we isolated, sequenced, and compared 627 phages of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Their genetic diversity is considerable, and there are 28 distinct genomic types (clusters) with related nucleotide sequences. However, amino acid sequence comparisons show pervasive genomic mosaicism, and quantification of inter-cluster and intra-cluster relatedness reveals a continuum of genetic diversity, albeit with uneven representation of different phages. Furthermore, rarefaction analysis shows that the mycobacteriophage population is not closed, and there is a constant influx of genes from other sources. Phage isolation and analysis was performed by a large consortium of academic institutions, illustrating the substantial benefits of a disseminated, structured program involving large numbers of freshman undergraduates in scientific discovery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Sorensen2011,
abstract = {In this paper, we develop a method, termed the Interaction Distribution (ID) method, for analysis of quantitative ecological network data. In many cases, quantitative network data sets are under-sampled, i.e. many interactions are poorly sampled or remain unobserved. Hence, the output of statistical analyses may fail to differentiate between patterns that are statistical artefacts and those which are real characteristics of ecological networks. The ID method can support assessment and inference of under-sampled ecological network data. In the current paper, we illustrate and discuss the ID method based on the properties of plant-animal pollination data sets of flower visitation frequencies. However, the ID method may be applied to other types of ecological networks. The method can supplement existing network analyses based on two definitions of the underlying probabilities for each combination of pollinator and plant species: (1), pi,j: the probability for a visit made by the i'th pollinator species to take place on the j'th plant species; (2), qi,j: the probability for a visit received by the j'th plant species to be made by the i'th pollinator. The method applies the Dirichlet distribution to estimate these two probabilities, based on a given empirical data set. The estimated mean values for pi,j and qi,j reflect the relative differences between recorded numbers of visits for different pollinator and plant species, and the estimated uncertainty of pi,j and qi,j decreases with higher numbers of recorded visits.},

@article{Amari2017,
abstract = {Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher informa-tion metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of n ele-ments and studied the geometry of the probability simplex S n−1 , which is the set of all probability distributions over n elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in S n−1 by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution p to distribution q, where p, q ∈ S n−1 . We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The op-timal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost C(p, q) was computationally much less de-manding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at p = q. To define a proper divergence while re-taining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold S n−1 ×S n−1 of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans Shun-ichi Amari 2-1 Hirosawa, Shun-ichi Amari et al. and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in S n−1 that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence.},

abstract = {Using a spatially explicit cellular automaton model with local competition, we investigate the potential for varied levels of competitive intransitivity (i.e., nonhierarchical competition) to promote species coexistence. As predicted, on average, increased levels of intransitivity result in more sustained coexistence within simulated communities, although the outcome of competition also becomes increasingly unpredictable. Interestingly, even a moderate degree of intransitivity within a community can promote coexistence, in terms of both the length of time until the first competitive exclusion and the number of species remaining in the community after 500 simulated generations. These results suggest that modest levels of intransitivity in nature, such as those that are thought to be characteristic of plant communities, can contribute to coexistence and, therefore, community-scale biodiversity. We explore a potential connection between competitive intransitivity and neutral theory, whereby competitive intransitivity may represent an important mechanism for "ecological equivalence."},

abstract = {Darwin's classic image of an "entangled bank" of interdependencies among species has long suggested that it is difficult to predict how the loss of one species affects the abundance of others. We show that for dynamical models of realistically structured ecological networks in which pair-wise consumer-resource interactions allometrically scale to the (3/4) power--as suggested by metabolic theory--the effect of losing one species on another can be predicted well by simple functions of variables easily observed in nature. By systematically removing individual species from 600 networks ranging from 10-30 species, we analyzed how the strength of 254,032 possible pair-wise species interactions depended on 90 stochastically varied species, link, and network attributes. We found that the interaction strength between a pair of species is predicted well by simple functions of the two species' biomasses and the body mass of the species removed. On average, prediction accuracy increases with network size, suggesting that greater web complexity simplifies predicting interaction strengths. Applied to field data, our model successfully predicts interactions dominated by trophic effects and illuminates the sign and magnitude of important nontrophic interactions.},

abstract = {Motivation: Histone modifications are among the most important factors that control gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expression from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their combinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing 'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels either failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods that separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a unified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to classify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system, called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among important features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions among histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique that generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides an intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate genes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models like Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression classification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The output of our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations but also allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histone modification marks, some of which have recently been observed by experimental studies.},

A key goal of this work is to demonstrate that with RLS, we get certain things " for free " : if we can solve a single supervised RLS problem, we can search for a good regularization parameter $\lambda$ at essentially no additional cost. The discussion in this paper applies to " dense " regularized least squares, where we work with matrix factorizations of the data or kernel matrix. It is also possible to work with iterative methods such as conjugate gradient, and this is frequently the method of choice for large data sets in high dimensions with very few nonzero dimensions per point, such as text classifciation tasks. The results discussed here do not apply to iterative methods, which have different design tradeoffs. We present the results in greater detail than strictly necessary, erring on the side of showing our work. We hope that this will be useful to people trying to learn more about linear algebra manipulations in the machine learning context.},

Instances of this problem in machine learning include multi-task learning, collaborative filtering and multi-view learning, among others. Our goal is to elucidate the form of the optimal solution of spectral learning. The theory of spectral learning relies on the von Neumann characterization of orthogonally invariant norms and their association with symmetric gauge functions.

abstract = {We show how the success of deep learning depends not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can be approximated through "cheap learning" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones, because they have simplifying properties tracing back to the laws of physics. The exceptional simplicity of physics-based functions hinges on properties such as symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial log-probability, and we explore how these properties translate into exceptionally simple neural networks approximating both natural phenomena such as images and abstract representations thereof such as drawings. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to renormalization group procedures. Various "no-flattening theorems" show when these efficient deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss - even for linear networks.},

@article{Lo2005,
abstract = {Knowledge of protein-protein interaction is useful for elucidating protein function via the concept of 'guilt-by-association'. A statistical learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), has recently been explored for the prediction of protein-protein interactions using artificial shuffled sequences as hypothetical noninteracting proteins and it has shown promising results (Bock, J. R., Gough, D. A., Bioinformatics 2001, 17, 455-460). It remains unclear however, how the prediction accuracy is affected if real protein sequences are used to represent noninteracting proteins. In this work, this effect is assessed by comparison of the results derived from the use of real protein sequences with that derived from the use of shuffled sequences. The real protein sequences of hypothetical noninteracting proteins are generated from an exclusion analysis in combination with subcellular localization information of interacting proteins found in the Database of Interacting Proteins. Prediction accuracy using real protein sequences is 76.9{\%} compared to 94.1{\%} using artificial shuffled sequences. The discrepancy likely arises from the expected higher level of difficulty for separating two sets of real protein sequences than that for separating a set of real protein sequences from a set of artificial sequences. The use of real protein sequences for training a SVM classification system is expected to give better prediction results in practical cases. This is tested by using both SVM systems for predicting putative protein partners of a set of thioredoxin related proteins. The prediction results are consistent with observations, suggesting that real sequence is more practically useful in development of SVM classification system for facilitating protein-protein interaction prediction.},

abstract = {Revealing the ecological principles that shape communities is a major challenge of the post-genomic era. To date, a systematic approach for describing inter-species interactions has been lacking. Here we independently predict the competitive and cooperative potential between 6,903 bacterial pairs derived from a collection of 118 species' metabolic models. We chart an intricate association between competition and cooperation indicating that the cooperative potential is maximized at moderate levels of resource overlap. Utilizing ecological data from 2,801 samples, we explore the associations between bacterial interactions and coexistence patterns. The high level of competition observed between species with mutual-exclusive distribution patterns supports the role of competition in community assembly. Cooperative interactions are typically unidirectional with no obvious benefit to the giver. However, within their natural communities, bacteria typically form close cooperative loops resulting in indirect benefit to all species involved. These findings are important for the future design of consortia optimized towards bioremediation and bio-production applications.},

@article{Qiu2008,
abstract = {Proteins do not carry out their functions alone. Instead, they often act by participating in macromolecular complexes and play different functional roles depending on the other members of the complex. It is therefore interesting to identify co-complex relationships. Although protein complexes can be identified in a high-throughput manner by experimental technologies such as affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (APMS), these large-scale datasets often suffer from high false positive and false negative rates. Here, we present a computational method that predicts co-complexed protein pair (CCPP) relationships using kernel methods from heterogeneous data sources. We show that a diffusion kernel based on random walks on the full network topology yields good performance in predicting CCPPs from protein interaction networks. In the setting of direct ranking, a diffusion kernel performs much better than the mutual clustering coefficient. In the setting of SVM classifiers, a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel. We also show that combination of complementary information improves the performance of our CCPP recognizer. A summation of three diffusion kernels based on two-hybrid, APMS, and genetic interaction networks and three sequence kernels achieves better performance than the sequence kernels or diffusion kernels alone. Inclusion of additional features achieves a still better ROC(50) of 0.937. Assuming a negative-to-positive ratio of 600ratio1, the final classifier achieves 89.3{\%} coverage at an estimated false discovery rate of 10{\%}. Finally, we applied our prediction method to two recently described APMS datasets. We find that our predicted positives are highly enriched with CCPPs that are identified by both datasets, suggesting that our method successfully identifies true CCPPs. An SVM classifier trained from heterogeneous data sources provides accurate predictions of CCPPs in yeast. This computational method thereby provides an inexpensive method for identifying protein complexes that extends and complements high-throughput experimental data.},

While being a generic framework to handle statistics properly, it is also known to be sensitive to noise and outliers, and is not suitable for direct application to images without additional post-processing regularization to remove ar-tifacts. To tackle these issues, we propose to directly deal with the regularity of the transport map and the spatial consistency of the reconstruction. Our approach is based on the relaxed and regularized discrete opti-mal transport method of [8]. We extend this work by (i) modeling the spatial distribution of colors within the im-age domain and (ii) tuning automatically the relaxation parameters.

abstract = {1. The study of plant-pollinator interactions in a network context is receiving increasing attention. This approach has helped to identify several emerging network patterns such as nestedness and modularity. However, most studies are based only on qualitative information, and some ecosystems, such as deserts and tropical forests, are underrepresented in these data sets. 2. We present an exhaustive analysis of the structure of a 4-year plant-pollinator network from the Monte desert in Argentina using qualitative and quantitative tools. We describe the structure of this network and evaluate sampling completeness using asymptotic species richness estimators. Our goal is to assess the extent to which the realized sampling effort allows for an accurate description of species interactions and to estimate the minimum number of additional censuses required to detect 90{\%} of the interactions. We evaluated completeness of detection of the community-wide pollinator fauna, of the pollinator fauna associated with each plant species and of the plant-pollinator interactions. We also evaluated whether sampling completeness was influenced by plant characteristics, such as flower abundance, flower life span, number of interspecific links (degree) and selectiveness in the identity of their flower visitors, as well as sampling effort. 3. We found that this desert plant-pollinator network has a nested structure and that it exhibits modularity and high network-level generalization. 4. In spite of our high sampling effort, and although we sampled 80{\%} of the pollinator fauna, we recorded only 55{\%} of the interactions. Furthermore, although a 64{\%} increase in sampling effort would suffice to detect 90{\%} of the pollinator species, a fivefold increase in sampling effort would be necessary to detect 90{\%} of the interactions. 5. Detection of interactions was incomplete for most plant species, particularly specialists with a long flowering season and high flower abundance, or generalists with short flowering span and scant flowers. Our results suggest that sampling of a network with the same effort for all plant species is inadequate to sample interactions. 6. Sampling the diversity of interactions is labour intensive, and most plant-pollinator networks published to date are likely to be undersampled. Our analysis allowed estimating the completeness of our sampling, the additional effort needed to detect most interactions and the plant traits that influence the detection of their interactions.},

@article{Norouzzadeh,
abstract = {Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about wildlife location and behavior across broad geographic areas would revo-lutionize our ability to study, conserve, and manage species and ecosystems. Currently, such data are mostly gathered manually at great expense, and thus are sparsely and infrequently collected. Here we investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inex-pensively collect such data, which could transform many fields of biology, ecology, and zoology into " big data " sciences. Motion sen-sor cameras called " camera traps " enable pictures of wildlife to be collected inexpensively, unobtrusively, and at high-volume. However, identifying the animals, animal attributes, and behaviors in these pic-tures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task often per-formed by researchers, hired technicians, or crowdsourced teams of human volunteers. In this paper, we demonstrate that such data can be automatically extracted by deep neural networks (aka deep learning), which is a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. In particular, we use the existing human-labeled, single-animal images from the Snapshot Serengeti dataset to train deep convolutional neu-ral networks for identifying 48 species in 3.2 million images taken from Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. In this paper we train neural networks that automatically identify animals with over 92{\%} accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, we can choose to have our system classify only the im-ages it is highly confident about, allowing valuable human time to be focused only on challenging images. In this case, our system can automate animal identification for 96.9{\%} of the data while still per-forming at the same 96.6{\%} accuracy level of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving approximately ∼8.2 years (at 40 hours per week) of human labeling effort (i.e. over 17,000 hours) on a 3.2-million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains immediately highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data ex-traction from camera-trap images. The improvements in accuracy we expect in years to come suggest that this technology could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume and perhaps even real-time collection of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.},

abstract = {Although an abundance of bacteriophages exists, little is known about interactions between their proteins and those of their bacterial hosts. Here, we experimentally determined the phage-host interactomes of the phages Dp-1 and Cp-1 and their underlying protein interaction network in the host Streptococcus pneumoniae. We compared our results to the interaction patterns of E. coli phages lambda and T7. Dp-1 and Cp-1 target highly connected host proteins, occupy central network positions, and reach many protein clusters through the interactions of their targets. In turn, lambda and T7 targets cluster to conserved and essential proteins in E. coli, while such patterns were largely absent in S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, targets in E. coli were mutually strongly intertwined, while targets of Dp-1 and Cp-1 were strongly connected through essential and orthologous proteins in their immediate network vicinity. In both phage-host systems, the impact of phages on their protein targets appears to extend from their network neighbors, since proteins that interact with phage targets were located in central network positions, have a strong topologically disruptive effect and touch complexes with high functional heterogeneity. Such observations suggest that the phages, biological impact is accomplished through a surprisingly limited topological reach of their targets.},

abstract = {The process of learning good features for ma-chine learning applications can be very compu-tationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototyp-ical example of this is the one-shot learning set-ting, in which we must correctly make predic-tions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity be-tween inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discrimina-tive features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art perfor-mance on one-shot classification tasks. Humans exhibit a strong ability to acquire and recognize new patterns. In particular, we observe that when presented with stimuli, people seem to be able to understand new concepts quickly and then recognize variations on these concepts in future percepts (Lake et al., 2011). Machine learning has been successfully used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications such as web search, spam detection, caption generation, and speech and image recognition. However, these algorithms often break down when forced to make predictions about data for which little supervised information is available. We desire to generalize to these unfamiliar categories without neces-sitating extensive retraining which may be either expensive or impossible due to limited data or in an online prediction setting, such as web retrieval.},

abstract = {Species-rich tropical communities are expected to be more specialized than their temperate counterparts. Several studies have reported increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics, whereas others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias or differences in plant diversity. Thus, the direction of the latitudinal specialization gradient remains contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities.},

abstract = {Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect inferences, however.},

abstract = {Inferring protein functions from structures is a challenging task, as a large number of orphan protein structures from structural genomics project are now solved without their biochemical functions characterized. For proteins binding to similar substrates or ligands and carrying out similar functions, their binding surfaces are under similar physicochemical constraints, and hence the sets of allowed and forbidden residue substitutions are similar. However, it is difficult to isolate such selection pressure due to protein function from selection pressure due to protein folding, and evolutionary relationship reflected by global sequence and structure similarities between proteins is often unreliable for inferring protein function. We have developed a method, called pevoSOAR (pocket-based evolutionary search of amino acid residues), for predicting protein functions by solving the problem of uncovering amino acids residue substitution pattern due to protein function and separating it from amino acids substitution pattern due to protein folding. We incorporate evolutionary information specific to an individual binding region and match local surfaces on a large scale with millions of precomputed protein surfaces to identify those with similar functions. Our pevoSOAR method also generates a probablistic model called the computed binding a profile that characterizes protein-binding activities that may involve multiple substrates or ligands. We show that our method can be used to predict enzyme functions with accuracy. Our method can also assess enzyme binding specificity and promiscuity. In an objective large-scale test of 100 enzyme families with thousands of structures, our predictions are found to be sensitive and specific: At the stringent specificity level of 99.98{\%}, we can correctly predict enzyme functions for 80.55{\%} of the proteins. The overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve measuring the performance of our prediction is 0.955, close to the perfect value of 1.00. The best Matthews coefficient is 86.6{\%}. Our method also works well in predicting the biochemical functions of orphan proteins from structural genomics projects.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect PPI based on pairwise similarity and using only the primary structure of the protein. The PPI based on Pairwise Similarity (PPI-PS) method consists of a representation of each protein sequence by a vector of pairwise similarities against large subsequences of amino acids created by a shifting window which passes over concatenated protein training sequences. Each coordinate of this vector is typically the E-value of the Smith-Waterman score. These vectors are then used to compute the kernel matrix which will be exploited in conjunction with support vector machines.},

We consider the full and almost full cold start problem in dyadic prediction, a setting that occurs when both objects in an out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them has been observed, but very few times. A popular approach for addressing this problem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature representation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor product pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we introduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the fields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that the two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel approach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive performance. Moreover, unlike existing tensor product kernel methods, the two-step method allows closed-form solutions for training and parameter selection via cross-validation estimates both in the full and almost full cold start settings, making the approach much more efficient and straightforward to implement.},

abstract = {* The possession of certain floral traits can determine which insects visit a plant species. If two species possess similar floral traits that determine shared flower visitors, floral traits can be said to mediate plant–plant interactions. Such indirect interactions are important for understanding fundamental relationships of plant communities, such as competition and facilitation but thus far have only been tested within a native community context. * We test whether floral-trait similarity can be used to predict interactions between an invasive plant and co-occurring native species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We surveyed flower visitation at invaded and uninvaded plots across four sites and correlated floral-trait similarity between invasive and native species with both invasion impact on native flower visitation and flower visitor overlap of natives and the invasive species. * Similarity of all traits (categorical and continuous) and categorical traits alone explained invasion impact (flower visitor overlap) between the native and invasive species. The majority of flower visitor overlap was attributed to the native honeybee Apis mellifera subsp. capensis. * This study is the first to show that floral traits can be used to predict novel plant–plant interactions, even amongst ecologically generalized flower visitors and plants and to predict potential impacts of an invasive species on native flowering communities. However, floral traits were not useful for predicting changes in visitation to plant species. * Synthesis. Results advance our understanding of the role of plant traits in ecological communities and reveal that they are important in mediating not only plant–pollinator interactions but also plant–plant interactions. Our findings also shed light on invasive–native plant interactions via pollinators and have the potential to predict certain invasion impacts},

More specifically, suppose has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)—so the coefficients belong to an ball for 0 1. The most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with 2 error (1 2 1). It is possible to design = (log()) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attain-able with direct knowledge of the most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those important coeffi-cients is extracted from the measurements by solving a linear program—Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of " random " linear combi-nations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of -widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand -widths of balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0 1, and give a criterion identifying near-optimal subspaces for Gel'fand -widths.

abstract = {We describe a technique for comparing distributions without the need for density estimation as an intermediate step. Our approach re-lies on mapping the distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Applications of this technique can be found in two-sample tests, which are used for determining whether two sets of observations arise from the same distribution, covariate shift correction, local learning, measures of independence, and density estimation. Kernel methods are widely used in supervised learning [1, 2, 3, 4], however they are much less established in the areas of testing, estimation, and analysis of probability distributions, where information theoretic approaches [5, 6] have long been dominant. Recent examples include [7] in the context of construction of graphical models, [8] in the context of feature extraction, and [9] in the context of independent component analysis. These methods have by and large a com-mon issue: to compute quantities such as the mutual information, entropy, or Kullback-Leibler divergence, we require sophisticated space partitioning and/or bias correction strategies [10, 9]. In this paper we give an overview of methods which are able to compute distances between distributions without the need for intermediate density esti-mation. Moreover, these techniques allow algorithm designers to specify which properties of a distribution are most relevant to their problems. We are opti-mistic that our embedding approach to distribution representation and analysis will lead to the development of algorithms which are simpler and more effective than entropy-based methods in a broad range of applications.},

abstract = {We use the language of uninformative Bayesian prior choice to study the selection of appropriately simple effective models. We advocate for the prior which maximizes the mutual information between parameters and predictions, learning as much as pos-sible from limited data. When many parameters are poorly con-strained by the available data, we find that this prior puts weight only on boundaries of the parameter space. Thus, it selects a lower-dimensional effective theory in a principled way, ignoring irrelevant parameter directions. In the limit where there are suf-ficient data to tightly constrain any number of parameters, this reduces to the Jeffreys prior. However, we argue that this limit is pathological when applied to the hyperribbon parameter mani-folds generic in science, because it leads to dramatic dependence on effects invisible to experiment. effective theory | model selection | renormalization group | Bayesian prior choice | information theory},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses are central to many research areas in biology and typically involve the identification of homologous sequences, their multiple alignment, the phylogenetic reconstruction and the graphical representation of the inferred tree. The Phylogeny.fr platform transparently chains programs to automatically perform these tasks. It is primarily designed for biologists with no experience in phylogeny, but can also meet the needs of specialists; the first ones will find up-to-date tools chained in a phylogeny pipeline to analyze their data in a simple and robust way, while the specialists will be able to easily build and run sophisticated analyses. Phylogeny.fr offers three main modes. The 'One Click' mode targets non-specialists and provides a ready-to-use pipeline chaining programs with recognized accuracy and speed: MUSCLE for multiple alignment, PhyML for tree building, and TreeDyn for tree rendering. All parameters are set up to suit most studies, and users only have to provide their input sequences to obtain a ready-to-print tree. The 'Advanced' mode uses the same pipeline but allows the parameters of each program to be customized by users. The 'A la Carte' mode offers more flexibility and sophistication, as users can build their own pipeline by selecting and setting up the required steps from a large choice of tools to suit their specific needs. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, users can also collect neighbors of a query sequence by running BLAST on general or specialized databases. A guide tree then helps to select neighbor sequences to be used as input for the phylogeny pipeline. Phylogeny.fr is available at: http://www.phylogeny.fr/},

abstract = {Motivation: Computational prediction of compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is of great importance for drug design and development, as genome-scale experimental validation of CPIs is not only time-consuming but also prohibitively expensive. With the availability of an increasing number of validated interactions, the performance of computational prediction approaches is severely impended by the lack of reliable negative CPI samples. A systematic method of screening reliable negative sample becomes critical to improving the performance of in silico prediction methods. Results: This article aims at building up a set of highly credible negative samples of CPIs via an in silico screening method. As most existing computational models assume that similar compounds are likely to interact with similar target proteins and achieve remarkable performance, it is rational to identify potential negative samples based on the converse negative proposition that the proteins dissimilar to every known/predicted target of a compound are not much likely to be targeted by the compound and vice versa. We integrated various resources, including chemical structures, chemical expression profiles and side effects of compounds, amino acid sequences, protein-protein interaction network and functional annotations of proteins, into a systematic screening framework. We first tested the screened negative samples on six classical classifiers, and all these classifiers achieved remarkably higher performance on our negative samples than on randomly generated negative samples for both human and Caenorhabditis elegans. We then verified the negative samples on three existing prediction models, including bipartite local model, Gaussian kernel profile and Bayesian matrix factorization, and found that the performances of these models are also significantly improved on the screened negative samples. Moreover, we validated the screened negative samples on a drug bioactivity dataset. Finally, we derived two sets of new interactions by training an support vector machine classifier on the positive interactions annotated in DrugBank and our screened negative interactions. The screened negative samples and the predicted interactions provide the research community with a useful resource for identifying new drug targets and a helpful supplement to the current curated compound-protein databases.

abstract = {The widely known binary relevance method for multi-label classification, which considers each label as an independent binary problem, has often been overlooked in the literature due to the perceived inadequacy of not directly modelling label correlations. Most current methods invest considerable complexity to model interdependencies between labels. This paper shows that binary relevance-based methods have much to offer, and that high predictive performance can be obtained without impeding scalability to large datasets. We exemplify this with a novel classifier chains method that can model label correlations while maintaining acceptable computational complexity. We extend this approach further in an ensemble framework. An extensive empirical evaluation covers a broad range of multi-label datasets with a variety of evaluation metrics. The results illustrate the competitiveness of the chaining method against related and state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of predictive performance and time complexity.},

Utilizing binary-Y2H, co-complex and binary literature curated interaction sets in both organisms we found that characteristics of interaction sets that were determined with the same experimental methods were strikingly similar. While essentiality is frequently considered a question of a protein's increasing number of interactions, we found that binary-Y2H interactions failed to show such a trend in both organisms. Furthermore, essential genes are enriched in protein complexes in both organisms. In turn, binary-Y2H interactions hold more bottleneck interactions than co-complex interactions while both binary-Y2H and co-complex interactions are strongly enriched among co-regulated proteins and transcription factors. We discuss if such similarities are a consequence of the underlying methodology or rather reflect truly different biological patterns.},

abstract = {The fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Op-timization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning re-searchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical pro-gramming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed im-provements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general pur-pose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.},

abstract = {Recent studies of plant–animal mutualistic networks have assumed that interaction frequency between mutualists predicts species impacts (population-level effects), and that field estimates of interaction strength (per-interaction effects) are unnecessary. Although existing evidence supports this assumption for the effect of animals on plants, no studies have evaluated it for the reciprocal effect of plants on animals. We evaluate this assumption using data on the reproductive effects of pollinators on plants and the reciprocal reproductive effects of plants on pollinators. The magnitude of species impacts of plants on pollinators, the reciprocal impacts of pollinators on plants, and their asymmetry were well predicted by interaction frequency. However, interaction strength was a key determinant of the sign of species impacts. These results underscore the importance of quantifying interaction strength in studies of mutualistic networks. We also show that the distributions of interaction strengths and species impacts are highly skewed, with few strong and many weak interactions. This skewed distribution matches the pattern observed in food webs, suggesting that the community-wide organization of species interactions is fundamentally similar between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Our results have profound ecological implications, given the key role of interaction strength for community stability.},

We test our SGE hypothesis in the interactions of teosinte (Zea mays ssp. mexicana) with its rhizosphere soil biota in populations across a climate gradient. In support of SGE predictions, we find local adaptation of teosinte to soil biota at the stressful (cold) end of our climatic gradient but not at the benign (warm) end: sympatric combinations of plants and biota from stressful sites both increase plant fitness and generate more lo-cally adapted plant phenotypes. Our results suggest that co-adaptation of interacting partners may be a means of ameliorating stressful environments.},

In particular, the analysis provides sharp results on the “out-of-sample” prediction error, as opposed to the “in-sample” (fixed design) error. The analysis also reveals the effect of errors in the estimated covariance structure, as well as the effect of modeling errors; neither of which effects are present in the fixed design setting.

abstract = {An important class of problems involves training deep neural networkswith sparse prediction targets of very high dimensionD. These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Com- puting the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weightmatrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, this case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approxi- mate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In thisworkwe develop an original algorithmic approach that, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all inO(d2) per example instead ofO(Dd), remarkablywithout ever computing theD-dimensional output. The proposed algorithmis expected to yield an actual speedup of at least D 4d , i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture.},

Here, we present a general mathematical and computational framework to deal with the problem of data reliability in complex networks. In particular, we are able to reliably identify both missing and spurious interactions in noisy network observations. Remarkably, our approach also enables us to obtain, from those noisy observations, network reconstructions that yield estimates of the true network properties that are more accurate than those provided by the observations themselves. Our approach has the potential to guide experiments, to better characterize network data sets, and to drive new discoveries.},

abstract = {We find recurring amino-acid residue packing patterns, or spatial motifs, that are characteristic of protein structural families, by applying a novel frequent subgraph mining algorithm to graph representations of protein three-dimensional structure. Graph nodes represent amino acids, and edges are chosen in one of three ways: first, using a threshold for contact distance between residues; second, using Delaunay tessellation; and third, using the recently developed almost-Delaunay edges. For a set of graphs representing a protein family from the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database, subgraph mining typically identifies several hundred common subgraphs corresponding to spatial motifs that are frequently found in proteins in the family but rarely found outside of it. We find that some of the large motifs map onto known functional regions in two protein families explored in this study, i.e., serine proteases and kinases. We find that graphs based on almost-Delaunay edges significantly reduce the number of edges in the graph representation and hence present computational advantage, yet the patterns extracted from such graphs have a biological interpretation approximately equivalent to that of those extracted from distance based graphs.},

@article{Warton2015,
abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many of the questions posed in ecology require the consideration of abundance (see Glossary, including presence/absence) collected simultaneously across multiple taxonomic groups, for example species. The abundances in different taxa typically form the response variables in a multivariate analysis and are analyzed for several different goals, recent examples include: to study the impact of experimental removal of invasive crayfish on macroinvertebrate communities [1], to find taxa that can act as indicators of biodiversity loss due to logging and oil palm disturbance [2], to find leading environmental correlates of feral cat diet via meta-analysis [3], and to predict microbial interaction networks from co-occurrence data [4]. The number of taxa in an assemblage is typically larger than what can be modeled using classical multivariate analyses [5] – for example, the alpine plant data of Box 2 were sampled across 75 sites and represent almost as many species (65). If organisms are identified using modern tools such as DNA barcoding and metabarcoding [6,7], their number can be especially large, often in the thousands. Further, the data often have many zeros, and the samples therefore may not be rich in information – the European tree data analyzed in Box 3 had over 3000 plots, but half the species were each found in only 50 plots or less. Historically, the large number of taxa to be jointly analyzed, relative to the information available on each, has been technically challenging [8]. However, this is changing rapidly.},

abstract = {The field of supramolecular chemistry focuses on the non-covalent interactions between molecules that give rise to molecular recognition and self-assembly processes. Since most non-covalent interactions are relatively weak and form and break without significant activation barriers, many supramolecular systems are under thermodynamic control. Hence, traditionally, supramolecular chemistry has focused predominantly on systems at equilibrium. However, more recently, self-assembly processes that are governed by kinetics, where the outcome of the assembly process is dictated by the assembly pathway rather than the free energy of the final assembled state, are becoming topical. Within the kinetic regime it is possible to distinguish between systems that reside in a kinetic trap and systems that are far from equilibrium and require a continuous supply of energy to maintain a stationary state. In particular, the latter systems have vast functional potential, as they allow, in principle, for more elaborate structural and functional diversity of self-assembled systems [mdash] indeed, life is a prime example of a far-from-equilibrium system. In this Review, we compare the different thermodynamic regimes using some selected examples and discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed when developing new functional supramolecular systems.},

In this work, we show that all of the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of the normalized Laplacian matrix of a network; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertex context is set to one; (3) As an extension to LINE, PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple Laplacian matrices; (4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF method as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding. Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE (up to 38{\%} relatively) in several conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better understanding of latent network representations.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {The combination of synthetic and systems biology is a powerful framework to study fundamental questions in biology and produce chemicals of immediate practical application such as biofuels, polymers, or therapeutics. However, we cannot yet engineer biological systems as easily and precisely as we engineer physical systems. In this review, we describe the path from the choice of target molecule to scaling production up to commercial volumes. We present and explain some of the current challenges and gaps in our knowledge that must be overcome in order to bring our bioengineering capabilities to the level of other engineering disciplines. Challenges start at molecule selection, where a difficult balance between economic potential and biological feasibility must be struck. Pathway design and construction have recently been revolutionized by next-generation sequencing and exponentially improving DNA synthesis capabilities. Although pathway optimization can be significantly aided by enzyme expression characterization through proteomics, choosing optimal relative protein expression levels for maximum production is still the subject of heuristic, non-systematic approaches. Toxic metabolic intermediates and proteins can significantly affect production, and dynamic pathway regulation emerges as a powerful but yet immature tool to prevent it. Host engineering arises as a much needed complement to pathway engineering for high bioproduct yields; and systems biology approaches such as stoichiometric modeling or growth coupling strategies are required. A final, and often underestimated, challenge is the successful scale up of processes to commercial volumes. Sustained efforts in improving reproducibility and predictability are needed for further development of bioengineering.},

abstract = {1.Significant advances in both mathematical and molecular approaches in ecology offer unprecedented opportunities to describe and understand ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks describe interactions between species, the underlying structure of communities and the function and stability of ecosystems. They provide the ability to assess the robustness of complex ecological communities to species loss, as well as a novel way of guiding restoration. However, empirically quantifying the interactions between entire communities remains a significant challenge. 2.Concomitantly, advances in DNA sequencing technologies are resolving previously intractable questions in functional and taxonomic biodiversity and provide enormous potential to determine hitherto difficult to observe species-interactions. Combining DNA metabarcoding approaches with ecological network analysis presents important new opportunities for understanding large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as providing powerful tools for building ecosystems that are resilient to environmental change. 3.We propose a novel ‘nested tagging' metabarcoding approach for the rapid construction of large, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks. Taking tree-insect-parasitoid ecological networks as an illustration, we show how measures of network robustness, constructed using DNA metabarcoding, can be used to determine the consequences of tree species loss within forests, and forest habitat loss within wider landscapes. By determining which species and habitats are important to network integrity, we propose new directions for forest management. 4.Merging metabarcoding with ecological network analysis provides a revolutionary opportunity to construct some of the largest, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks to date, providing new ways to: (i) monitor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; (ii) assess the robustness of interacting communities to species loss; and (iii) build ecosystems that are more resilient to environmental change.},

abstract = {Food-web descriptors serve as a means for among-web comparisons that are necessary for the discovery of regularities in respect to food-web structure. Qualitative descriptors were however found to be highly sensitive to varying levels of sampling effort. To circumvent these shortcomings, quantitative counterparts were proposed which take the magnitude of trophic interaction between species into consideration. For 14 properties we examined the performance with increasing sampling effort of a qualitative, an unweighted quantitative (giving the same weight to each taxon), and a weighted quantitative version (weighing each taxon by the amount of incoming and outgoing flows). The evaluation of 10 extensively documented quantitative webs formed the basis for this analysis. The quantitative versions were found to be much more robust against variable sampling effort. This increase in accuracy is accomplished at the cost of a slight decrease in precision as compared to the qualitative properties. Conversely, the quantitative descriptors also proved less sensitive to differences in evenness in the distribution of link magnitude. By more adequately incorporating the information inherent to quantitative food-web compilations, quantitative descriptors are able to better represent the web, and are thus more suitable for the elucidation of general trends in food-web structure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) form a vast and diverse enzyme class of particular interest in drug development and a high biotechnological potential. Although very diverse in sequence, they share a common structural fold. For the comprehensive and systematic comparison of protein sequences and structures the Cytochrome P450 Engineering Database (CYPED) was established. It was built up based on an extensible data model that enables its functions readily enhanced. DESCRIPTION: The new version of the CYPED contains information on sequences and structures of 8613 and 47 proteins, respectively, which strictly follow Nelson's classification rules for homologous families and superfamilies. To gain biochemical information on substrates and inhibitors, the CYPED was linked to the Cytochrome P450 Knowledgebase (CPK). To overcome differences in the data model and inconsistencies in the content of CYPED and CPK, a metric was established based on sequence similarity to link protein sequences as primary keys. In addition, the annotation of structurally and functionally relevant residues was extended by a reliable prediction of conserved secondary structure elements and by information on the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The online accessible version of the CYPED at http://www.cyped.uni-stuttgart.de provides a valuable tool for the analysis of sequences, structures and their relationships to biochemical properties.},

abstract = {Parasitism is the most common animal lifestyle, yet food webs rarely include parasites. The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness.},

abstract = {Species abundance distribution (SAD) is a classic topic of multispecies ecology. Different types of SAD may indicate specific environmental conditions. A possible way to present some properties of a theoretical or empirical SAD is the construction of a rank-abundance curve (RAC). With regard to the applicability of the RAC as a widely used indicator of the structure of a multispecies community and of the ecological status of its habitat, a basic question is the link between the type of SAD and the shape of the associated RAC. One of the simplest ways to characterize a RAC is to determine its concave and convex segments. However, none of ecological textbooks does give a clear-cut guideline concerning this issue. In the paper a connection is presented between some types of SAD and the convex and concave segments of the related RAC: including among others linearity for the geometric SAD (e.g. with communities in early stage of succession), convexity for the Zipf-Mandelbrot SAD (e.g. with communities with slow successional process), and convexity and then concavity with an inflexion point at approximately the mode of the associated histogram for the lognormal SAD (e.g. with climax, equilibrium communities). Our approach has the potential to improve and justify the use of RACs when searching for the determinants of community structure, initiating further studies in this field. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecological networks of two interacting guilds of species, such as flowering plants and pollinators, are common in nature, and studying their structure can yield insights into their resilience to environmental disturbances. Here we develop analytical methods for exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant-pollinator community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore, pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition; closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a common fate in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of the phenotypic performance of a hybrid plant based on the molecular fingerprints of its parents should lead to a more cost-effective breeding programme as it allows to reduce the number of expensive field evaluations. The construction of a reliable prediction model requires a representative sample of hybrids for which both molecular and phenotypic information are accessible. This phenotypic information is usually readily available as typical breeding programmes test numerous new hybrids in multi-location field trials on a yearly basis. Earlier studies indicated that a linear mixed model analysis of this typically unbalanced phenotypic data allows to construct epsilon-insensitive support vector machine regression and best linear prediction models for predicting the performance of single-cross maize hybrids. We compare these prediction methods using different subsets of the phenotypic and marker data of a commercial maize breeding programme and evaluate the resulting prediction accuracies by means of a specifically designed field experiment. This balanced field trial allows to assess the reliability of the cross-validation prediction accuracies reported here and in earlier studies. The limits of the predictive capabilities of both prediction methods are further examined by reducing the number of training hybrids and the size of the molecular fingerprints. The results indicate a considerable discrepancy between prediction accuracies obtained by cross-validation procedures and those obtained by correlating the predictions with the results of a validation field trial. The prediction accuracy of best linear prediction was less sensitive to a reduction of the number of training examples compared with that of support vector machine regression. The latter was, however, better at predicting hybrid performance when the size of the molecular fingerprints was reduced, especially if the initial set of markers had a low information content.},

We here describe a fine-tuned coevolutionary state of a flower-visiting bee that collects both nectar and pollen from an early spring flower visited by multiple pollinators. Detailed morphology of the bee proboscis is shown to be finely adjusted to the floral morphology and nectar production of the flower. Behavioral observations also confirm the precision of this mutualism.

abstract = {Several stochastic models have tried to capture the architecture of food webs. This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20{\%} of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73{\%} of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs. Our approach opens the door to the formulation of more complex models that can be applied to any kind of biological network.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Proteochemometrics is a novel technology for the analysis of interactions of series of proteins with series of ligands. We have here customized it for analysis of large datasets and evaluated it for the modeling of the interaction of psychoactive organic amines with all the five known families of amine G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). RESULTS: The model exploited data for the binding of 22 compounds to 31 amine GPCRs, correlating chemical descriptions and cross-descriptions of compounds and receptors to binding affinity using a novel strategy. A highly valid model (q2 = 0.76) was obtained which was further validated by external predictions using data for 10 other entirely independent compounds, yielding the high q2ext = 0.67. Interpretation of the model reveals molecular interactions that govern psychoactive organic amines overall affinity for amine GPCRs, as well as their selectivity for particular amine GPCRs. The new modeling procedure allows us to obtain fully interpretable proteochemometrics models using essentially unlimited number of ligand and protein descriptors.},

abstract = {A major problem in genome annotation is whether it is valid to transfer the function from a characterised protein to a homologue of unknown activity. Here, we show that one can employ a strategy that uses a structure-based prediction of protein functional sites to assess the reliability of functional inheritance. We have automated and benchmarked a method based on the evolutionary trace approach. Using a multiple sequence alignment, we identified invariant polar residues, which were then mapped onto the protein structure. Spatial clusters of these invariant residues formed the predicted functional site. For 68 of 86 proteins examined, the method yielded information about the observed functional site. This algorithm for functional site prediction was then used to assess the validity of transferring the function between homologues. This procedure was tested on 18 pairs of homologous proteins with unrelated function and 70 pairs of proteins with related function, and was shown to be 94 {\%} accurate. This automated method could be linked to schemes for genome annotation. Finally, we examined the use of functional site prediction in protein-protein and protein-DNA docking. The use of predicted functional sites was shown to filter putative docked complexes with a discrimination similar to that obtained by manually including biological information about active sites or DNA-binding residues.},

abstract = {Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variables. Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding configurations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables are given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models, including traditional discriminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, conditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all possible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in the design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches.},

abstract = {Randomized algorithms for very large matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years. Much of this work was motivated by problems in large-scale data analysis. Although this work had its origins within theoretical computer science, where researchers were interested in proving worst-case bounds, i.e., bounds without any assumptions at all on the input data, researchers from numerical linear algebra, statistics, applied mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning, as well as domain scientists have subsequently extended and applied these methods in important ways. Although this has been great for the development of the area and for the technology transfer of theoretical ideas into practical applications, this interdisciplinarity has thus far sometimes obscured the underlying simplicity and generality of the core ideas. This review will provide a detailed overview of recent work on randomized algorithms for matrix problems, with an emphasis on a few simple core ideas that underlie not only recent theoretical advances but also the usefulness of these tools in large-scale data applications. Crucial in this context is the connection with concept of statistical leverage. This concept has long been used in statistical regression diagnostics to identify outliers; and it has recently proved crucial in the development of improved worst-case matrix algorithms that are also amenable to high-quality numerical implementation and that are useful to domain scientists. This connection arises naturally when one explicitly decouples the effect of randomization in these matrix algorithms from the underlying linear algebraic structure. This decoupling also permits much finer control in the application of randomization, as well as the easier exploitation of domain knowledge.},

In contrast to macroscopic organisms, their environmental preferences and ecological interdependencies remain difficult to assess, requiring laborious molecular surveys at diverse sampling sites. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of previously sampled microbial lineages in the environment. We grouped publicly available 16S ribosomal RNA sequences into operational taxonomic units at various levels of resolution and systematically searched these for co-occurrence across environments. Naturally occurring microbes, indeed, exhibited numerous, significant interlineage associations. These ranged from relatively specific groupings encompassing only a few lineages, to larger assemblages of microbes with shared habitat preferences. Many of the coexisting lineages were phylogenetically closely related, but a significant number of distant associations were observed as well. The increased availability of completely sequenced genomes allowed us, for the first time, to search for genomic correlates of such ecological associations. Genomes from coexisting microbes tended to be more similar than expected by chance, both with respect to pathway content and genome size, and outliers from these trends are discussed. We hypothesize that groupings of lineages are often ancient, and that they may have significantly impacted on genome evolution.},

From a frequentist/discriminative perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a Bayesian/generative perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is also known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.},

abstract = {The relationship between structure and stability in ecological networks and the effect of spatial dynamics on natural communities have both been major foci of ecological research for decades. Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species' spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) control the dynamic spatial patterns of regulatory gene expression in development. Thus, in principle, GRN models may provide system-level, causal explanations of developmental process. To test this assertion, we have transformed a relatively well-established GRN model into a predictive, dynamic Boolean computational model. This Boolean model computes spatial and temporal gene expression according to the regulatory logic and gene interactions specified in a GRN model for embryonic development in the sea urchin. Additional information input into the model included the progressive embryonic geometry and gene expression kinetics. The resulting model predicted gene expression patterns for a large number of individual regulatory genes each hour up to gastrulation (30 h) in four different spatial domains of the embryo. Direct comparison with experimental observations showed that the model predictively computed these patterns with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. In addition, we used this model to carry out in silico perturbations of regulatory functions and of embryonic spatial organization. The model computationally reproduced the altered developmental functions observed experimentally. Two major conclusions are that the starting GRN model contains sufficiently complete regulatory information to permit explanation of a complex developmental process of gene expression solely in terms of genomic regulatory code, and that the Boolean model provides a tool with which to test in silico regulatory circuitry and developmental perturbations.},

abstract = {Interacting systems are prevalent in nature, from dynamical systems in physics to complex societal dynamics. The interplay of components can give rise to complex behavior, which can often be explained using a simple model of the system's constituent parts. In this work, we introduce the neural relational inference (NRI) model: an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data. Our model takes the form of a variational auto-encoder, in which the latent code represents the underlying interaction graph and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. In experiments on simulated physical systems, we show that our NRI model can accurately recover ground-truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. We further demonstrate that we can find an interpretable structure and predict complex dynamics in real motion capture and sports tracking data.},

abstract = {This study asks whether the spatial scale of sampling alters structural properties of food webs and whether any differences are attributable to changes in species richness and connectance with scale. Understanding how different aspects of sampling effort affect ecological network structure is important for both fundamental ecological knowledge and the application of network analysis in conservation and management. Using a highly resolved food web for the marine intertidal ecosystem of the Sanak Archipelago in the Eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska, we assess how commonly studied properties of network structure differ for 281 versions of the food web sampled at five levels of spatial scale representing six orders of magnitude in area spread across the archipelago. Species (S) and link (L) richness both increased by approximately one order of magnitude across the five spatial scales. Links per species (L/S) more than doubled, while connectance (C) decreased by approximately two-thirds. Fourteen commonly studied properties of network structure varied systematically with spatial scale of sampling, some increasing and others decreasing. While ecological network properties varied systematically with sampling extent, analyses using the niche model and a power-law scaling relationship indicate that for many properties, this apparent sensitivity is attributable to the increasing S and decreasing C of webs with increasing spatial scale. As long as effects of S and C are accounted for, areal sampling bias does not have a special impact on our understanding of many aspects of network structure. However, attention does need be paid to some properties such as the fraction of species in loops, which increases more than expected with greater spatial scales of sampling.},

abstract = {Kronecker product kernel provides the standard approach in the kernel methods literature for learning from pair-input data, where both data points and prediction tasks have their own feature representations. The methods allow simultaneous generalization to both new tasks and data unobserved in the training sample, a setting known as zero-shot or zero-data learning. Such a setting occurs in numerous applications, including drug-target interaction prediction, collaborative filtering and information retrieval. Efficient training algorithms based on the so-called vec trick, that makes use of the special structure of the Kronecker product, are known for the case where the output matrix for the training sample is fully observed, i.e. the correct output for each data point-task combination is available. In this work we generalize these results, proposing an efficient algorithm for sampled Kronecker product multiplication, where only a subset of the full Kronecker product, that corresponds to the training sample, is computed. This allows us to derive a general framework for training Kronecker kernel methods, as specific examples we implement Kronecker ridge regression and support vector machine algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to accurate models, while allowing order of magnitude improvements in training and prediction time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Researchers interested in analysing the expression patterns of functionally related genes usually hope to improve the accuracy of their results beyond the boundaries of currently available experimental data. Gene ontology (GO) data provides a novel way to measure the functional relationship between gene products. Many approaches have been reported for calculating the similarities between two GO terms, known as semantic similarities. However, biologists are more interested in the relationship between gene products than in the scores linking the GO terms. To highlight the relationships among genes, recent studies have focused on functional similarities. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated five functional similarity methods using both protein-protein interaction (PPI) and expression data of S. cerevisiae. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and correlation coefficient analysis of these methods showed that the maximum method outperformed the other methods. Statistical comparison of multiple- and single-term annotated proteins in biological process ontology indicated that genes with multiple GO terms may be more reliable for separating true positives from noise. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the reliability of current approaches that elevate the similarity of GO terms to the similarity of proteins. Suggestions for further improvements in functional similarity analysis are also provided.},

abstract = {{\#}{\#}{\#} BACKGROUND As global climate change accelerates, one of the most urgent tasks for the coming decades is to develop accurate predictions about biological responses to guide the effective protection of biodiversity. Predictive models in biology provide a means for scientists to project changes to species and ecosystems in response to disturbances such as climate change. Most current predictive models, however, exclude important biological mechanisms such as demography, dispersal, evolution, and species interactions. These biological mechanisms have been shown to be important in mediating past and present responses to climate change. Thus, current modeling efforts do not provide sufficiently accurate predictions. Despite the many complexities involved, biologists are rapidly developing tools that include the key biological processes needed to improve predictive accuracy. The biggest obstacle to applying these more realistic models is that the data needed to inform them are almost always missing. We suggest ways to fill this growing gap between model sophistication and information to predict and prevent the most damaging aspects of climate change for life on Earth. {\#}{\#}{\#} ADVANCES On the basis of empirical and theoretical evidence, we identify six biological mechanisms that commonly shape responses to climate change yet are too often missing from current predictive models: physiology; demography, life history, and phenology; species interactions; evolutionary potential and population differentiation; dispersal, colonization, and range dynamics; and responses to environmental variation. We prioritize the types of information needed to inform each of these mechanisms and suggest proxies for data that are missing or difficult to collect. We show that even for well-studied species, we often lack critical information that would be necessary to apply more realistic, mechanistic models. Consequently, data limitations likely override the potential gains in accuracy of more realistic models. Given the enormous challenge of collecting this detailed information on millions of species around the world, we highlight practical methods that promote the greatest gains in predictive accuracy. Trait-based approaches leverage sparse data to make more general inferences about unstudied species. Targeting species with high climate sensitivity and disproportionate ecological impact can yield important insights about future ecosystem change. Adaptive modeling schemes provide a means to target the most important data while simultaneously improving predictive accuracy. {\#}{\#}{\#} OUTLOOK Strategic collections of essential biological information will allow us to build generalizable insights that inform our broader ability to anticipate species' responses to climate change and other human-caused disturbances. By increasing accuracy and making uncertainties explicit, scientists can deliver improved projections for biodiversity under climate change together with characterizations of uncertainty to support more informed decisions by policymakers and land managers. Toward this end, a globally coordinated effort to fill data gaps in advance of the growing climate-fueled biodiversity crisis offers substantial advantages in efficiency, coverage, and accuracy. Biologists can take advantage of the lessons learned from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's development, coordination, and integration of climate change projections. Climate and weather projections were greatly improved by incorporating important mechanisms and testing predictions against global weather station data. Biology can do the same. We need to adopt this meteorological approach to predicting biological responses to climate change to enhance our ability to mitigate future changes to global biodiversity and the services it provides to humans. ![Figure][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Emerging models are beginning to incorporate six key biological mechanisms that can improve predictions of biological responses to climate change. Models that include biological mechanisms have been used to project (clockwise from top) the evolution of disease-harboring mosquitoes, future environments and land use, physiological responses of invasive species such as cane toads, demographic responses of penguins to future climates, climate-dependent dispersal behavior in butterflies, and mismatched interactions between butterflies and their host plants. Despite these modeling advances, we seldom have the detailed data needed to build these models, necessitating new efforts to collect the relevant data to parameterize more biologically realistic predictive models. New biological models are incorporating the realistic processes underlying biological responses to climate change and other human-caused disturbances. However, these more realistic models require detailed information, which is lacking for most species on Earth. Current monitoring efforts mainly document changes in biodiversity, rather than collecting the mechanistic data needed to predict future changes. We describe and prioritize the biological information needed to inform more realistic projections of species' responses to climate change. We also highlight how trait-based approaches and adaptive modeling can leverage sparse data to make broader predictions. We outline a global effort to collect the data necessary to better understand, anticipate, and reduce the damaging effects of climate change on biodiversity. [1]: pending:yes},

abstract = {A novel method for the analysis of drug receptor interactions has been developed and used to explore mechanisms involved in the binding of 4-piperidyl oxazole antagonists to alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors. The method exploits affinity data for a series of organic chemical compounds binding to wild-type and artificially mutated receptors. The receptor sequences and compounds are assigned predictor variables that are correlated to the measured pharmacological activities using partial least-squares projections to latent structures. The predictor variables consist of one descriptor block derived from the chemical properties of the receptors' primary amino acid sequences and another descriptor block derived from the chemical properties of the organic compounds. The cross-terms generated from the two descriptor blocks are also derived. Using this approach, very sturdy models were generated describing the interactions of the chemical compounds with the receptors. Models are useful to predict binding affinity and receptor subtype selectivity of compounds prior to their synthesis, and may find use in rational drug design. Moreover, models also give quantitative information about the interactions of the amino acids of the receptors with the ligands, thereby giving an insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in ligand binding.},

A theoretical framework is perceived as particularly successful if it can explain very disparate facts. The observation that some apparently complex phenomena can exhibit startling similarities to dynamics generated with simple mathematical models (1) has led to empirical searches for fundamental laws by inspecting data for qualitative agreement with the behavior of such models. A striking feature that has attracted considerable attention is the apparent ubiquity of power-law relationships in empirical data. However, although power laws have been reported in areas ranging from finance and molecular biology to geophysics and the Internet, the data are typically insufficient and the mechanistic insights are almost always too limited for the identification of power-law behavior to be scientifically useful (see the figure). Indeed, even most statistically “successful” calculations of power laws offer little more than anecdotal value.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide an introduction to machine learning tasks that address important problems in genomic medicine. One of the goals of genomic medicine is to determine how variations in the DNA of individuals can affect the risk of different diseases, and to find causal explanations so that targeted therapies can be designed. Here we focus on how machine learning can help to model the relationship between DNA and the quantities of key molecules in the cell, with the premise that these quantities, which we refer to as cell variables, may be associated with disease risks. Modern biology allows high-throughput measurement of many such cell variables, including gene expression, splicing, and proteins binding to nucleic acids, which can all be treated as training targets for predictive models. With the growing availability of large-scale data sets and advanced computational techniques such as deep learning, researchers can help to usher in a new era of effective genomic medicine.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {1. Ecological networks have been shown to display a nested structure. To be nested, a network must consist of a core group of generalists all interacting with each other, and with extreme specialists interacting only with generalist species. 2. Studies on ecological networks are especially prone to sampling effects, as they involve entire species assemblages. However, we know of no study addressing to what extent nestedness depends on sampling effort, despite the numerous studies discussing the ecological and evolutionary implications of nested networks. 3. Here we manipulate sampling effort in time and space and show that nestedness is less sensitive to sampling effort than number of species and links within the network. 4. That a structural property of an ecological network appears less prone to sampling bias is encouraging for other studies of ecological networks. This is because it indicates that the sensitivity of ecological networks properties to effects of sampling effort might be smaller than previously expected.},

Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and application scenarios.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

Here we summarize recent work that addresses these challenges at multiple scales, starting from two-species natural and synthetic ecology models, up to biosphere-level approaches. Among the many fascinating open challenges in this field is whether the integration of high throughput sequencing methods and mathematical models will help us capture emerging principles of ecosystem-level metabolic organization and evolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In this paper we describe work in progress in developing
kernel methods for enzyme function prediction. Our focus is in developing
so called structured output prediction methods, where the enzymatic
reaction is the combinatorial target object for prediction. We compared
two structured output prediction methods, the Hierarchical Max-Margin
Markov algorithm (HM3) and the Maximum Margin Regression algorithm
(MMR) in hierarchical classification of enzyme function. As sequence
features we use various string kernels and the GTG feature set derived
from the global alignment trace graph of protein sequences.RESULTS:In
our experiments, in predicting enzyme EC classification we obtain
over 85 accuracy (predicting the four digit EC code) and over 91{\%}
microlabel F1 score (predicting individual EC digits). In predicting
the Gold Standard enzyme families, we obtain over 79{\%} accuracy (predicting
family correctly) and over 89{\%} microlabel F1 score (predicting superfamilies
and families). In the latter case, structured output methods are
significantly more accurate than nearest neighbor classifier. A polynomial
kernel over the GTG feature set turned out to be a prerequisite for
accurate function prediction. Combining GTG with string kernels boosted
accuracy slightly in the case of EC class prediction.CONCLUSION:Structured
output prediction with GTG features is shown to be computationally
feasible and to have accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches
in enzyme function prediction.},

While each of these states is generally resilient, exposure to antibiotics, probiotics, or different diets often trigger transitions to other states. Can we predict which specific perturbations will cause such transitions? Here we present a new conceptual model — inspired by the stable marriage problem — which both exhibits these emergent phenomena and makes such predictions. Our model's core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time, while competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables with microbes' nutrient preferences and competitive abilities, we can determine all the stable states as well as the specific perturbations driving a community from one state to another. Using an example of 7 Bacteroides species utilizing 9 polysaccharides common to the human gut, we predict that mutual complementarity in nutrient preferences enables these species to coexist at high abundances.},

abstract = {Overwhelmed with genomic data, biologists are facing the first big post-genomic question--what do all genes do? First, not only is the volume of pure sequence and structure data growing, but its diversity is growing as well, leading to a disproportionate growth in the number of uncharacterized gene products. Consequently, established methods of gene and protein annotation, such as homology-based transfer, are annotating less data and in many cases are amplifying existing erroneous annotation. Second, there is a need for a functional annotation which is standardized and machine readable so that function prediction programs could be incorporated into larger workflows. This is problematic due to the subjective and contextual definition of protein function. Third, there is a need to assess the quality of function predictors. Again, the subjectivity of the term 'function' and the various aspects of biological function make this a challenging effort. This article briefly outlines the history of automated protein function prediction and surveys the latest innovations in all three topics.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are vital in the functioning of all ecosystems; however, most microorganisms are uncultivated, and their roles in natural systems are unclear. Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

We consider domain adaptation under three possible scenarios: (1) the marginal P Y changes, while the conditional P X|Y stays the same (target shift), (2) the marginal P Y is fixed, while the conditional P X|Y changes with certain constraints (conditional shift), and (3) the marginal P Y changes, and the conditional P X|Y changes with constraints (generalized target shift). Using background knowledge, causal interpretations allow us to determine the correct situation for a problem at hand. We exploit importance reweight-ing or sample transformation to find the learning machine that works well on test data, and propose to estimate the weights or transformations by reweighting or trans-forming training data to reproduce the covari-ate distribution on the test domain. Thanks to kernel embedding of conditional as well as marginal distributions, the proposed ap-proaches avoid distribution estimation, and are applicable for high-dimensional problems.

We present a method based on the assumption that proteins that function together in a pathway or structural complex are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion. During evolution, all such functionally linked proteins tend to be either preserved or eliminated in a new species. We describe this property of correlated evolution by characterizing each protein by its phylogenetic profile, a string that encodes the presence or absence of a protein in every known genome. We show that proteins having matching or similar profiles strongly tend to be functionally linked. This method of phylogenetic profiling allows us to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins.},

abstract = {Author SummaryIntegrated information theory (IIT) approaches the relationship between consciousness and its physical substrate by first identifying the fundamental properties of experience itself: existence, composition, information, integration, and exclusion. IIT then postulates that the physical substrate of consciousness must satisfy these very properties. We develop a detailed mathematical framework in which composition, information, integration, and exclusion are defined precisely and made operational. This allows us to establish to what extent simple systems of mechanisms, such as logic gates or neuron-like elements, can form complexes that can account for the fundamental properties of consciousness. Based on this principled approach, we show that IIT can explain many known facts about consciousness and the brain, leads to specific predictions, and allows us to infer, at least in principle, both the quantity and quality of consciousness for systems whose causal structure is known. For example, we show that some simple systems can be minimally conscious, some complicated systems can be unconscious, and two different systems can be functionally equivalent, yet one is conscious and the other one is not.},

Supervised learning approach, bipartite local model (BLM), has recently been shown to be effective in prediction of drug-target interactions. However, for drug-candidate compounds or target-candidate proteins that currently have no known interactions available, its pure 'local' model is not able to be learned and hence BLM may fail to make correct prediction when involving such kind of new candidates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a simple procedure called neighbor-based interaction-profile inferring (NII) and integrate it into the existing BLM method to handle the new candidate problem. Specifically, the inferred interaction profile is treated as label information and is used for model learning of new candidates. This functionality is particularly important in practice to find targets for new drug-candidate compounds and identify targeting drugs for new target-candidate proteins. Consistent good performance of the new BLM-NII approach has been observed in the experiment for the prediction of interactions between drugs and four categories of target proteins. Especially for nuclear receptors, BLM-NII achieves the most significant improvement as this dataset contains many drugs/targets with no interactions in the cross-validation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the NII strategy and also shows the great potential of BLM-NII for prediction of compound-protein interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: jpmei@ntu.edu.sg$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50{\%} of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species' interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

abstract = {The theoretical basis and quantitative evaluation of a new approach for modeling biofilm growth are presented here. Soluble components (e.g., substrates) are represented in a continuous field, whereas discrete mapping is used for solid components (e.g., biomass). The spatial distribution of substrate is calculated by applying relaxation methods to the reaction-diffusion mass balance. A biomass density map is determined from direct integration in each grid cell of a substrate-limited growth equation. Spreading and distribution of biomass is modeled by a discrete cellular automaton algorithm. The ability of this model to represent diffusion-reaction-microbial growth systems was tested for a well-characterized system: immobilized cells growing in spherical gel beads. Good quantitative agreement with data for global oxygen consumption rate was found. The calculated concentration profiles of substrate and biomass in gel beads corresponded to those measured. Moreover, it was possible, using the discrete spreading algorithm, to predict the spatial two- and three-dimensional distribution of microorganisms in relation to, for example, substrate flux and inoculation density. The new technique looks promising for modeling diffusion-reaction-microbial growth processes in heterogeneous systems as they occur in biofilms.},

abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a “black art” requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

Learnheuristics can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems with dynamic inputs (COPDIs). In these COPDIs, the problem inputs (elements either located in the objective function or in the constraints set) are not fixed in advance as usual. On the contrary, they might vary in a predictable (non-random) way as the solution is partially built according to some heuristic-based iterative process. For instance, a consumer's willingness to spend on a specific product might change as the availability of this product decreases and its price rises. Thus, these inputs might take different values depending on the current solution configuration. These variations in the inputs might require from a coordination between the learning mechanism and the metaheuristic algorithm: at each iteration, the learning method updates the inputs model used by the metaheuristic.},

Consider a point-to-point communication network on which a number of information sources are to be multicast to certain sets of destinations. We assume that the information sources are mutually independent. The problem is to characterize the admissible coding rate region. This model subsumes all previously studied models along the same line. We study the problem with one information source, and we have obtained a simple characterization of the admissible coding rate region. Our result can be regarded as the max-flow min-cut theorem for network information flow. Contrary to one's intuition, our work reveals that it is in general not optimal to regard the information to be multicast as a “fluid” which can simply be routed or replicated. Rather, by employing coding at the nodes, which we refer to as network coding, bandwidth can in general be saved. This finding may have significant impact on future design of switching systems},

Environmental cues received during development and by the mother as an adult act as detection-based (individually observed) cues. The mother's phenotype and a quantitative genetic effect act as selection-based cues (they correlate with environmental states after selection). We specify when such cues are complementary and tend to be used together, and when using the most informative cue will predominate. Thus, we extend recent analyses of the evolutionary implications of subsets of these effects by providing a general diagnosis of the conditions under which detection and selection-based influences on development are likely to evolve and coexist.},

We proceed with recommendations for sampling and data generation including sample and metadata collection, community profiling, construction of shotgun libraries, and sequencing strategies. We then discuss the application of generic sequence processing steps (read preprocessing, assembly, and gene prediction and annotation) to metagenomic data sets in contrast to genome projects. Different types of data analyses particular to metagenomes are then presented, including binning, dominant population analysis, and gene-centric analysis. Finally, data management issues are presented and discussed.

abstract = {To study the protein structure-function relationship, we propose a method to efficiently create three-dimensional maps of structure space using a very large dataset of {\textgreater}��30,000 Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) domains. In our maps, each domain is represented by a point, and the distance between any two points approximates the structural distance between their corresponding domains. We use these maps to study the spatial distributions of properties of proteins, and in particular those of local vicinities in structure space such as structural density and functional diversity. These maps provide a unique broad view of protein space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental properties thereof. At the same time, the maps are consistent with previous knowledge (e.g., domains cluster by their SCOP class) and organize in a unified, coherent representation previous observation concerning specific protein folds. To investigate the function-structure relationship, we measure the functional diversity (using the Gene Ontology controlled vocabulary) in local structural vicinities. Our most striking finding is that functional diversity varies considerably across structure space: The space has a highly diverse region, and diversity abates when moving away from it. Interestingly, the domains in this region are mostly alpha/beta structures, which are known to be the most ancient proteins. We believe that our unique perspective of structure space will open previously undescribed ways of studying proteins, their evolution, and the relationship between their structure and function.},

abstract = {The control of chaotic systems implies inducing an unpredictable system to follow a desired trajectory using the smallest "force". In low-dimensional continuous systems, one method is that of reconstructing the tangent space, so that the control may be concentrated on the most expanding directions. This scheme is hard to follow for high-dimensional (extended) systems. This is particularly true for extended systems that exhibit stable chaos, that is, systems which are not chaotic in the usual sense, but are unpredictable for finite perturbations. Prototypical of this class are cellular automata, aka completely discrete dynamical systems. Although usual indicators of chaoticity such as the maximum Lyapunov exponent may be defined for such systems, we show that the usual approach may lead to counter intuitive results, and that it is possible to exploit the characteristics of the system in order to reduce the distance between two replicas with less control.},

However, proteins that do not display any overall sequence or structure similarity may also bind similar ligands if they contain similar binding sites.

abstract = {One of the pressing open problems of computational systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high throughput genomic data, in particular microarray gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

This task is referred to as ordinal regression and is complementary to the standard machine learning tasks of classification and metric regression. In contrast to statistical models we present a distribution independent formulation of the problem together with uniform bounds of the risk functional. The approach presented is based on a mapping from objects to scalar utility values. Similar to Support Vector methods we derive a new learning algorithm for the task of ordinal regression based on large margin rank boundaries. We give experimental results for an information retrieval task: learning the order of documents w.r.t. an initial query. Experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm outperforms more naive approaches to ordinal regression such as Support Vector classification and Support Vector regression in the case of more than two ranks.},

abstract = {Comparative ecology uses interspecific relationships among traits, while accounting for the phylo- genetic non-independence of species, to uncover general evolutionary processes. Applied to biogeographic questions, it can be a powerful tool to explain the spatial distribution of organisms. Here, we review how comparative methods can elucidate biogeographic patterns and processes, using analyses of distributional data on parasites (fleas and helminths) as case studies. Methods exist to detect phylogenetic signals, i.e. the degree of phylogenetic dependence of a given character, and either to control for these signals in statistical analyses of interspecific data, or to measure their contribution to variance. Parasite–host interactions present a special case, as a given trait may be a parasite trait, a host trait or a property of the coevolved association rather than of one participant only. For some analyses, it is therefore necessary to correct simultaneously for both parasite phylo- geny and host phylogeny, or to evaluate which has the greatest influence on trait expression. Using comparative approaches, we show that two fundamental properties of parasites, their niche breadth, i.e. host specificity, and the nature of their life cycle, can explain interspecific and latitudinal vari- ation in the sizes of their geographical ranges, or rates of distance decay in the similarity of parasite communities. These findings illustrate the ways in which phylogenetically based comparative methods can contribute to biogeographic research.},

abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

abstract = {Network analyses of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species are very popular, but their biological interpretations are often unclear and incautious. Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either(1)niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or(2)impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host–parasitoid or plant–animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as ‘specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that ‘dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species ‘depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology. Mutualistische oder antagonistische Beziehungen zwischen Arten einer Gemeinschaft werden derzeit h{\"{a}}ufig mit Hilfe von Netzwerkanalysen beschrieben. Da die biologische Deutung solcher Analysen oft missverst{\"{a}}ndlich ist, wird in diesem Artikel vorgeschlagen, zwei Interpretationsarten zu unterscheiden:(1){\"{O}}kologische Nische, z.B. Spezialisierung, Nischenbreite und {\"{u}}berlappung, sowie Kompatibilit{\"{a}}t von Merkmalen zwischen Arten.(2)Interaktionseffekte, die von der relativen H{\"{a}}ufigkeit der Wechselwirkungen abh{\"{a}}ngig sind, z.B. Pr{\"{a}}dations- und Infektionsraten oder mutualistische Funktionen. Bei nischenbezogenen Deutungen von Netzwerken, die auf beobachteten Interaktionen basieren, muss jedoch ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden, dass die Gesamtzahl der Beobachtungen pro Art limitiert ist und sich zwischen Arten stark unterscheidet. Allein diese Variation kann viele Netzwerkmuster erkl{\"{a}}ren, beispielsweise “Nestedness”, was oft als asymmetrische Spezialisierung missverstanden wurde. Hier wird analytisch bewiesen, dass eine mutma{\ss}liche “Spezialisierungs-Asymmetrie” zwischen zwei Arten allein auf deren unterschiedliche Beobachtungsh{\"{a}}ufigkeit zur{\"{u}}ckgef{\"{u}}hrt werden kann. Unhabh{\"{a}}ngig erhobene Daten f{\"{u}}r beide Arten sind notwendig, um diesen Trugschluss zu vermeiden. Das Aussterben von Arten durch Verlust des Assoziationspartners (Koextinktion) wurde in mehreren publizierten Studien modelliert. Solche Simulationen basieren auf der Annahme, dass jede Art von seinen beobachteten Assoziationspartnern abh{\"{a}}ngig ist (nischenbasierte Deutung). Hier kann jedoch gezeigt werden, dass vor allem solche Arten scheinbar gef{\"{a}}hrdet sind, die nur ein- oder wenige Male beobachtet wurden, also nicht notwendigerweise Spezialisten darstellen. Die explizite Unterscheidung zwischen nischen- und effektbasierter Interpretation k{\"{o}}nnte demnach eine hilfreiche konzeptionelle Br{\"{u}}cke darstellen, um Netzwerkanalysen und klassische Gemeinschafts{\"{o}}kologie zusammenzuf{\"{u}}hren.},

abstract = {In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modification of community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time. The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of $\beta$-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up $\beta$-diversity of community composition to the $\beta$-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

Some examples include social networks in computational social sciences, sensor net-works in communications, functional networks in brain imag-ing, regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. In many applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks, on the scale of billions), and are natural targets for machine learning techniques. In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an un-derlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and man-ifolds. The purpose of this paper is to overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.},

abstract = {Competition is the most common type of interaction occurring between wood-decaying higher fungi. Since competition for nutrients in organic resources is effectively brought about by competition for space, the common division into interference and exploitation competition is not very appropriate. Fungal competition can be divided into primary resource capture (obtaining uncolonized resources) and secondary resource capture (combat to obtain resources already colonized by other fungi). Combative mechanisms include antagonism at a distance, hyphal interference, mycoparasitism and gross mycelial contact. Interactions can result in deadlock or replacement, and a hierarchy of combative ability can be discerned amongst fungi that inhabit particular resources, but within this hierarchy there exists intransitivity, modification of outcome by other species and abiotic variables. Interactions can dramatically alter mycelial function, and have potential as biological control agents of fungal pathogens of trees and in service timber.},

abstract = {We describe the draft genome of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex, which is only 200 megabases and contains at least 30,907 genes. The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia's genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication. Daphnia-specific genes, including many additional loci within sequenced regions that are otherwise devoid of annotations, are the most responsive genes to ecological challenges.},

Model-implied instrumental variables are the observed variables in the model that can serve as instrumental variables in a given equation. One difficulty inhibiting the practical use of the 2SLS estimator is identifying the model-implied IVs.

The prevalence of multiple morphs is a challenge to evolutionary theory because a single strategy should prevail unless morphs have exactly equal fitness4,5 or a fitness advantage when rare6,7. We report here the application of an evolutionary stable strategy model to a three-morph mating system in the side-blotched lizard. Using parameter estimates from field data, the model predicted oscillations in morph frequency, and the frequencies of the three male morphs were found to oscillate over a six-year period in the field. The fitnesses of each morph relative to other morphs were non-transitive in that each morph could invade another morph when rare, but was itself invadable by another morph when common. Concordance between frequency-dependent selection and the among-year changes in morph fitnesses suggest that male interactions drive a dynamic 'rock–paper–scissors' game7.},

abstract = {? The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.The formation of air emboli in the xylem during drought is one of the key processes leading to plant mortality due to loss in hydraulic conductivity, and strongly fuels the interest in quantifying vulnerability to cavitation. The acoustic emission (AE) technique can be used to measure hydraulic conductivity losses and construct vulnerability curves. For years, it has been believed that all the AE signals are produced by the formation of gas emboli in the xylem sap under tension. More recent experiments, however, demonstrate that gas emboli formation cannot explain all the signals detected during drought, suggesting that different sources of AE exist. This complicates the use of the AE technique to measure emboli formation in plants. We therefore analysed AE waveforms measured on branches of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. 'Chardonnay') during bench dehydration with broadband sensors, and applied an automated clustering algorithm in order to find natural clusters of AE signals. We used AE features and AE activity patterns during consecutive dehydration phases to identify the different AE sources. Based on the frequency spectrum of the signals, we distinguished three different types of AE signals, of which the frequency cluster with high 100-200 kHz frequency content was strongly correlated with cavitation. Our results indicate that cavitation-related AE signals can be filtered from other AE sources, which presents a promising avenue into quantifying xylem embolism in plants in laboratory and field conditions.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

abstract = {Abstract High-dimensional problem domains pose significant challenges for anomaly detection. The presence of irrelevant features can conceal the presence of anomalies. This problem, known as the ‘curse of dimensionality', is an obstacle for many anomaly detection techniques. Building a robust anomaly detection model for use in high-dimensional spaces requires the combination of an unsupervised feature extractor and an anomaly detector. While one-class support vector machines are effective at producing decision surfaces from well-behaved feature vectors, they can be inefficient at modelling the variation in large, high-dimensional datasets. Architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs) are a promising technique for learning robust features. We present a hybrid model where an unsupervised DBN is trained to extract generic underlying features, and a one-class SVM is trained from the features learned by the DBN. Since a linear kernel can be substituted for nonlinear ones in our hybrid model without loss of accuracy, our model is scalable and computationally efficient. The experimental results show that our proposed model yields comparable anomaly detection performance with a deep autoencoder, while reducing its training and testing time by a factor of 3 and 1000, respectively.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Compared to the available protein sequences of different organisms, the number of revealed protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is still very limited. So many computational methods have been developed to facilitate the identification of novel PPIs. However, the methods only using the information of protein sequences are more universal than those that depend on some additional information or predictions about the proteins. In this article, a sequence-based method is proposed by combining a new feature representation using auto covariance (AC) and support vector machine (SVM). AC accounts for the interactions between residues a certain distance apart in the sequence, so this method adequately takes the neighbouring effect into account. When performed on the PPI data of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the method achieved a very promising prediction result. An independent data set of 11,474 yeast PPIs was used to evaluate this prediction model and the prediction accuracy is 88.09{\%}. The performance of this method is superior to those of the existing sequence-based methods, so it can be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics studies.

abstract = {Motivation: Understanding functions of proteins in specific human tissues is essential for insights into disease diagnostics and therapeutics, yet prediction of tissue-specific cellular function remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. Results: Here we present OhmNet, a hierarchy-aware unsupervised node feature learning approach for multi-layer networks. We build a multi-layer network, where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue. OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes, to a neural embedding based low-dimensional space of features. OhmNet encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues, by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi-layer protein interaction network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue-specific cellular functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions of cellular function than alternative approaches, and also generates more accurate hypotheses about tissue-specific protein actions. We show that taking into account the tissue hierarchy leads to improved predictive power. Remarkably, we also demonstrate that it is possible to leverage the tissue hierarchy in order to effectively transfer cellular functions to a functionally uncharacterized tissue. Overall, OhmNet moves from flat networks to multiscale models able to predict a range of phenotypes spanning cellular subsystems.},

The biological consequences of multi-kinase activity are poorly defined, and an important step toward understanding the relationship between selectivity, efficacy and safety is the exploration of how inhibitors interact with the human kinome. We present interaction maps for 38 kinase inhibitors across a panel of 317 kinases representing {\textgreater}50{\%} of the predicted human protein kinome. The data constitute the most comprehensive study of kinase inhibitor selectivity to date and reveal a wide diversity of interaction patterns. To enable a global analysis of the results, we introduce the concept of a selectivity score as a general tool to quantify and differentiate the observed interaction patterns. We further investigate the impact of panel size and find that small assay panels do not provide a robust measure of selectivity.},

abstract = {Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) is one of the smallest viruses known. Its genome encodes only its coat protein (CP) subunit, relying on the polymerase of its helper virus TNV for replication. The genome has been shown to contain a cryptic set of dispersed assembly signals in the form of stem-loops that each present a minimal CP-binding motif AXXA in the loops. The genomic fragment encompassing nucleotides 1-127 is predicted to contain five such packaging signals (PSs). We have used mutagenesis to determine the critical assembly features in this region. These include the CP-binding motif, the relative placement of PS stem-loops, their number, and their folding propensity. CP binding has an electrostatic contribution, but assembly nucleation is dominated by the recognition of the folded PSs in the RNA fragment. Mutation to remove all AXXA motifs in PSs throughout the genome yields an RNA that is unable to assemble efficiently. In contrast, when a synthetic 127-nt fragment encompassing improved PSs is swapped onto the RNA otherwise lacking CP recognition motifs, assembly is partially restored, although the virus-like particles created are incomplete, implying that PSs outside this region are required for correct assembly. Swapping this improved region into the wild-type STNV1 sequence results in a better assembly substrate than the viral RNA, producing complete capsids and outcompeting the wild-type genome in head-to-head competition. These data confirm details of the PS-mediated assembly mechanism for STNV and identify an efficient approach for production of stable virus-like particles encapsidating nonnative RNAs or other cargoes.},

abstract = {Accurate modelling of biological systems requires a deeper and more complete knowledge about the molecular components and their functional associations than we currently have. Traditionally, new knowledge on protein associations generated by experiments has played a central role in systems modelling, in contrast to generally less trusted bio-computational predictions. However, we will not achieve realistic modelling of complex molecular systems if the current experimental designs lead to biased screenings of real protein networks and leave large, functionally important areas poorly characterised. To assess the likelihood of this, we have built comprehensive network models of the yeast and human proteomes by using a meta-statistical integration of diverse computationally predicted protein association datasets. We have compared these predicted networks against combined experimental datasets from seven biological resources at different level of statistical significance. These eukaryotic predicted networks resemble all the topological and noise features of the experimentally inferred networks in both species, and we also show that this observation is not due to random behaviour. In addition, the topology of the predicted networks contains information on true protein associations, beyond the constitutive first order binary predictions. We also observe that most of the reliable predicted protein associations are experimentally uncharacterised in our models, constituting the hidden or "dark matter" of networks by analogy to astronomical systems. Some of this dark matter shows enrichment of particular functions and contains key functional elements of protein networks, such as hubs associated with important functional areas like the regulation of Ras protein signal transduction in human cells. Thus, characterising this large and functionally important dark matter, elusive to established experimental designs, may be crucial for modelling biological systems. In any case, these predictions provide a valuable guide to these experimentally elusive regions.},

abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon ? /Wiener and Gini /Simpson ? indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S{\o}rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita -Horn index as special cases. What},

abstract = {Graph embedding methods represent nodes in a continuous vector space, preserving information from the graph (e.g. by sampling random walks). There are many hyper-parameters to these methods (such as random walk length) which have to be manually tuned for every graph. In this paper, we replace random walk hyper-parameters with trainable parameters that we automatically learn via backpropagation. In particular, we learn a novel attention model on the power series of the transition matrix, which guides the random walk to optimize an upstream objective. Unlike previous approaches to attention models, the method that we propose utilizes attention parameters exclusively on the data (e.g. on the random walk), and not used by the model for inference. We experiment on link prediction tasks, as we aim to produce embeddings that best-preserve the graph structure, generalizing to unseen information. We improve state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of real world datasets including social, collaboration, and biological networks. Adding attention to random walks can reduce the error by 20{\%} to 45{\%} on datasets we attempted. Further, our learned attention parameters are different for every graph, and our automatically-found values agree with the optimal choice of hyper-parameter if we manually tune existing methods.},

abstract = {A crucial task in many recommender problems like computational advertising, content optimization, and others is to retrieve a small set of items by scoring a large item inventory through some elaborate statistical/machine-learned model. This is challenging since the retrieval has to be fast (few milliseconds) to load the page quickly. Fast retrieval is well studied in the information retrieval (IR) literature, especially in the context of document retrieval for queries. When queries and documents have sparse representation and relevance is measured through cosine similarity (or some variant thereof), one could build highly efficient retrieval algorithms that scale gracefully to increasing item inventory. The key components exploited by such algorithms is sparse query-document representation and the special form of the relevance function. Many machine-learned models used in modern recommender problems do not satisfy these properties and since brute force evaluation is not an option with large item inventory, heuristics that filter out some items are often employed to reduce model computations at runtime. In this paper, we take a two-stage approach where the first stage retrieves top-K items using our approximate procedures and the second stage selects the desired top-k using brute force model evaluation on the K retrieved items. The main idea of our approach is to reduce the first stage to a standard IR problem, where each item is represented by a sparse feature vector (a.k.a. the vector-space representation) and the query-item relevance score is given by vector dot product. The sparse item representation is learnt to closely approximate the original machine-learned score by using retrospective data. Such a reduction allows leveraging extensive work in IR that resulted in highly efficient retrieval systems. Our approach is model-agnostic, relying only on data generated from the machine-learned model. We obtain significant improvements in the computational cost vs. accuracy tradeoff compared to several baselines in our empirical evaluation on both synthetic models and on a click-through (CTR) model used in online advertising.

Short-range interaction and limited dispersion allows for coexistence of competing species that cannot coexist in a well-mixed environment. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that destroy species diversity we study the intermediate situation of imperfect mixing, typical in aquatic media, in a model of cyclic competition between toxin producing, sensitive and resistant phenotypes. It is found, that chaotic mixing, by changing the character of the spatial distribution, induces coherent oscillations in the populations. The magnitude of the oscillations increases with the strength of mixing, leading to the extinction of some species beyond a critical mixing rate. When mixing is non-uniform in space, coexistence can be sustained at much stronger mixing by the formation of partially isolated regions, that prevent global extinction. The heterogeneity of mixing may enable toxin producing and sensitive strains to coexist for very long time at strong mixing.},

Noniterative, equation-by-equation estimators for factor analysis have received some attention, but little has been done on such estimators for latent variable equations. I propose an alternative 2SLS estimator of the parameters in LISREL type models and contrast it with the existing ones. The new 2SLS estimator allows observed and latent variables to originate from nonnormal distributions, is consistent, has a known asymptotic covafiance matrix, and is es- timable with standard statistical software. Diagnostics for evaluating instrumental variables are described. An empirical example illustrates the estimator.},

abstract = {Methanotrophs can form the basis of a methane-driven food web on which heterotrophic microorganisms can feed. In return, these heterotrophs can stimulate growth of methanotrophs in co-culture by providing growth additives. However, only a few specific interactions are currently known. We incubated nine methanotrophs with 25 heterotrophic strains in a pairwise miniaturized co-cultivation setup. Through principal component analysis and k-means clustering, methanotrophs and heterotrophs could be grouped according to their interaction behaviour, suggesting strain-dependent methanotroph-heterotroph complementarity. Co-cultivation significantly enhanced the growth parameters of three methanotrophs. This was most pronounced for Methylomonas sp. M5, with a threefold increase in maximum density and a fourfold increase in maximum increase in density in co-culture with Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG 19424. In contrast, co-cultivation with Methylobacterium radiotolerans LMG 2269 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 12228 inhibited growth of most methanotrophs. Functional genomic analysis suggested the importance of vitamin metabolism for co-cultivation success. The generated data set was then successfully exploited as a proof-of-principle for predictive modelling of co-culture responses based on other interactions of the same heterotrophs and methanotrophs, yielding values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 upon 50{\%} missing values for the maximum increase in density parameter. As such, these modelling-based tools were shown to hold great promise in reducing the amount of data that needs to be generated when conducting large co-cultivation studies.},

However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

To support claims of KT w.r.t. scalability we thus advocate to evaluate KT in a large-scale setting. To this end, we provide an extensive evaluation of three popular approaches to KT on a recently proposed large-scale data set, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition 2010 data set. In a first setting they are directly compared to one-vs-all classification often neglected in KT papers and in a second setting we evaluate their ability to enable zero-shot learning. While none of the KT methods can improve over one-vs-all classification they prove valuable for zero-shot learning, especially hierarchical and direct similarity based KT. We also propose and describe several extensions of the evaluated approaches that are necessary for this large-scale study.},

abstract = {1. The strength of the trophic link between any given pair of species in a food web is likely to depend on the presence and/or densities of other species in the community. How these trophic interaction modifications (TIMs) interact with one another to produce a net modifying effect is an important but under-explored issue. 2. We review several specific types of TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers, and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each other's effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4. Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect in many-species systems than expected from independent combination of modifications measured in systems with relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of their effects may require theory that distinguishes different 'functional groups' of modifiers and addresses how these are structured according to trophic relationships.},

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph convolutional networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

abstract = {Bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) have recently emerged as an exciting technology. In a BES, bacteria interact with electrodes using electrons, which are either removed or supplied through an electrical circuit. The most-described type of BES is microbial fuel cells (MFCs), in which useful power is generated from electron donors as, for example, present in wastewater. This form of charge transport, known as extracellular electron transfer, was previously extensively described with respect to metals such as iron and manganese. The importance of these interactions in global biogeochemical cycles is essentially undisputed. A wide variety of bacteria can participate in extracellular electron transfer, and this phenomenon is far more widespread than previously thought. The use of BESs in diverse research projects is helping elucidate the mechanism by which bacteria shuttle electrons externally. New forms of interactions between bacteria have been discovered demonstrating how multiple populations within microbial communities can co-operate to achieve energy generation. New environmental processes that were difficult to observe or study previously can now be simulated and improved via BESs. Whereas pure culture studies make up the majority of the studies performed thus far, even greater contributions of BESs are expected to occur in natural environments and with mixed microbial communities. Owing to their versatility, unmatched level of control and capacity to sustain novel processes, BESs might well serve as the foundation of a new environmental biotechnology. While highlighting some of the major breakthroughs and addressing only recently obtained data, this review points out that despite rapid progress, many questions remain unanswered.},

abstract = {A recent meta-analysis of meta-analyses by M{\o}ller and Jennions suggested that ecologists using statistical models are explaining between 2.5{\%} and 5.42{\%} of the variability in ecological studies. Although we agree that there is considerable variability in ecological systems that is not explained, we disagree with the approach and general conclusions of M{\o}ller and Jennions. As an alternate perspective, we explored the question: "How much ecological variation in relationships is not explained?" We did this by examining published studies in five different journals representative of the numerous sub-disciplines of ecology. We quantified the proportion of variance not explained in statistical models as the residual or random error compared to the total variation in the data set. Our results indicate that statistical models explain roughly half of the variation in variables of interest, vastly different from the 2.5{\%}-5.42{\%} reported by M{\o}ller and Jennions. This difference resulted largely from a different level of analysis: we considered the original study to be the appropriate level for quantifying variability while M{\o}ller and Jennions combined studies at different temporal and spatial scales and attempted to find universal single-factor relationships between ecological variables across study organisms or locations. Therefore, we believe that M{\o}ller and Jennions actually measured the universality of single factor effects across multiple ecological systems, not the amount of variability in ecological studies explained by ecologists. This study, combined with M{\o}ller and Jennions', illustrates importance of applying statistical models appropriately to assess ecological relationships.},

abstract = {The interactions that occur during the ripening of smear cheeses are not well understood. Yeast-yeast interactions and yeast-bacterium interactions were investigated within a microbial community composed of three yeasts and six bacteria found in cheese. The growth dynamics of this community was precisely described during the ripening of a model cheese, and the Lotka-Volterra model was used to evaluate species interactions. Subsequently, the effects on ecosystem functioning of yeast omissions in the microbial community were evaluated. It was found both in the Lotka-Volterra model and in the omission study that negative interactions occurred between yeasts. Yarrowia lipolytica inhibited mycelial expansion of Geotrichum candidum, whereas Y. lipolytica and G. candidum inhibited Debaryomyces hansenii cell viability during the stationary phase. However, the mechanisms involved in these interactions remain unclear. It was also shown that yeast-bacterium interactions played a significant role in the establishment of this multispecies ecosystem on the cheese surface. Yeasts were key species in bacterial development, but their influences on the bacteria differed. It appeared that the growth of Arthrobacter arilaitensis or Hafnia alvei relied less on a specific yeast function because these species dominated the bacterial flora, regardless of which yeasts were present in the ecosystem. For other bacteria, such as Leucobacter sp. or Brevibacterium aurantiacum, growth relied on a specific yeast, i.e., G. candidum. Furthermore, B. aurantiacum, Corynebacterium casei, and Staphylococcus xylosus showed reduced colonization capacities in comparison with the other bacteria in this model cheese. Bacterium-bacterium interactions could not be clearly identified.},

abstract = {Given a family of probability measures in P(X), the space of probability measures on a Hilbert space X, our goal in this paper is to highlight one ore more curves in P(X) that summarize efficiently that family. We propose to study this problem under the optimal transport (Wasserstein) geometry, using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric. We show that concepts that play a key role in Euclidean PCA, such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions, find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry, using Wasserstein means and differential geometry. The implementation of these ideas is, however, computationally challenging. To achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures, we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances. The interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms.},

abstract = {As a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, graph matching has applications in a variety of fields, from computer vision to computational biology. In graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different graphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main research focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for approximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In this paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate compatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching problem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide. We present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are pairs of graphs and the 'labels' are matches between them. Our experimental results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of standard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear assignment with such a learning scheme outperforms Graduated Assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm.},

abstract = {Detection of device-associated infectious processes is still an important clinical challenge. Bacteria grow adhered to the device surfaces creating biofilms that are resistant to antimicrobial agents, increasing mortality and morbidity. Thus there is need of a surgical procedure to remove the indwelling infected device. The elevated cost of these procedures, besides patients discomfort and increased risks, highlights the need to develop more efficient, accurate and rapid detection methods. Biosensors integrated with implantable devices will provide an effective diagnostic tool. In vivo, rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria attached to the device surfaces will allow efficient treatments. Impedance spectroscopy technique would be an adequate tool to detect the adherence and the growth of the microorganism by monitoring the impedance characteristics. In this work a label-free interdigitated microelectrode (IDAM) biosensor has been developed to be integrated with implantable devices. Impedance characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms has been performed achieving electrical monitoring of the bacterial growths in a few hours from the onset of the infection. This pathogen represents the most common microorganism related to intravascular catheters associated infections. The experimental setup presented in this work, a modified CDC biofilm reactor, simulates the natural environment conditions for bacterial biofilm development. The results prove that the low range of frequency is the most suitable setting for monitoring biofilm development. Our findings prove the effectiveness of this technique which shows variations of 59{\%} in the equivalent serial capacitance component of the impedance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {AIM: Although there is a vast body of literature on the causes of variation in species composition in ecological communities, less effort has been invested in understanding how interactions between these species vary. Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial dynamics. Here, we apply novel numerical tools to data on species interactions, and reveal that they vary more, and in response to different climate variables, than species do. LOCATION: Eurasia. METHODS: We used a measure of Locality Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host--parasite communities across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions. RESULTS: We show that interactions vary more, over space, than species do. In particular, we show that interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distribution or dissimilarity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Species interactions provide far more resolution than species occurrences alone, while still retaining all information about species occurrences. We suggest that they be put front and center in analyses of communities, especially in a biogeographic context.},

abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation and classification problems including very large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks},

The first task is a binary classification task which is to maximize accuracy of classification on an evenly-distributed test data set, given a fully labeled imbalanced training data set. The second task is also a binary classification task, but to maximize the F1-score of classification on a test data set, given a partially labeled training set. For task Technique), 1, I investigated several re-sampling techniques in improving the learning from the imbalanced data. These include SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Over- sampling by duplicating minority examples, random under- sampling. These techniques were used to create new balanced training data sets. Then three standard classifiers (Decision Tree, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Neural Network) were trained on the rebalanced training sets and used to classify the test set. The results showed the re-sampling techniques significantly improve the accuracy on the test set except for the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier. For task 2, I implemented two- step strategy algorithm to learn a classifier from the only positive and unlabeled data. In step 1, I implemented Spy technique to extract reliable negative (RN) examples. In step 2, I then used the labeled positive examples and the reliable negative examples as training set to learn standard Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier. The results showed the two-step algorithm significantly improves the F1 score compared to the learning that simply regards unlabeled examples as negative ones},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Machine learning may be the most popular computational tool in molecular biology. Providing sustained performance estimates is challenging. The standard cross-validation protocols usually fail in biology. Park {\&} Marcotte found that even refined protocols fail for protein-protein interactions (PPIs). RESULTS: Here, we sketch additional problems for the prediction of PPIs from sequence alone. Firstly, it not only matters whether proteins A or B of a target interaction A-B are similar to proteins of training interactions (positives), but also whether A or B are similar to proteins of non-interactions (negatives). Secondly, training on multiple interaction partners per protein did not improve performance for new proteins (not used to train). On the contrary, a strictly non-redundant training that ignored good data slightly improved the prediction of difficult cases. Thirdly, which prediction method appears to be best crucially depends on the sequence similarity between the test and the training set, how many true interactions should be found and the expected ratio of negatives to positives. The correct assessment of performance is the most complicated task in the development of prediction methods. Our analyses suggest that PPIs square the challenge for this task.

Under some conditions, stomatal apertures become synchronized into patches that exhibit richly complicated dynamics, similar to behaviors found in cellular automata that perform computational tasks. Using sequences of chlorophyll fluorescence images from leaves of Xanthium strumarium L. (cocklebur), we quantified spatial and temporal correlations in stomatal dynamics. Our values are statistically indistinguishable from those of the same correlations found in the dynamics of automata that compute.

We propose a framework for modeling the between- and within-individual components of the population niche as a set of variance-covariance matrices, which can be visualized with ellipses or ellipsoids. These niche components can be inferred using multiple response mixed models, and can incorporate diverse types of data, including diet composition, stable isotopes, spatial location, and other continuous measures of niche dimensions. We outline how considering both individual and population niches in multiple dimensions may enhance our understanding of key concepts in ecology and evolution. Considering multiple dimensions as well as the within-individual component of variation can lead to more meaningful measures of niche overlap between species. The impact of a population on its food w b y p h f ( J ' q y) w suggest how the dimensionality of individual specialization could amplify this effect. Finally, we draw from concepts in quantitative genetics and the study of animal personalities to propose new hypotheses about the ecological and evolutionary basis of niche shifts in multiple dimensions. We illustrate key ideas using empirical data from sea otters, wetland frogs, and threespine stickleback, and discuss outstanding questions about the consequences of multidimensional niche variation. Setting variation among individuals in an explicitly multivariate framework has the potential to transform our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

abstract = {Proteome-wide prediction of protein-protein interaction is a difficult and important problem in biology. Although there have been recent advances in both experimental and computational methods for predicting protein-protein interactions, we are only beginning to see a confluence of these techniques. In this paper, we describe a very general, high-throughput method for predicting protein-protein interactions. Our method combines a sequence-based description of proteins with experimental information that can be gathered from any type of protein-protein interaction screen. The method uses a novel description of interacting proteins by extending the signature descriptor, which has demonstrated success in predicting peptide/protein binding interactions for individual proteins. This descriptor is extended to protein pairs by taking signature products. The signature product is implemented within a support vector machine classifier as a kernel function.},

abstract = {The strength of trophic (feeding) links between two species depends on the traits of both the consumer and the resource. But which traits of consumer and resource have to be measured to predict link strengths, and how many? A novel theoretical framework for systematically determining trophic traits from empirical data was recently proposed. Here we demonstrate this approach for a group of 14 consumer fish species (Labeobarbus spp., Cyprinidae) and 11 aquatic resource categories coexisting in Lake Tana in northern Ethiopia, analysing large sets of phenotypic consumer and resource traits with known roles in feeding ecology. We systematically reconstruct structure and geometry of trophic niche space, in which link strengths are predicted by the distances between consumers and resources. These distances are then represented graphically resulting in an image of trophic niche space and its occupancy. We find trophic niche to be multidimensional. Among the models we analysed, one with two resource and two consumer traits had the highest predictive power for link strength. Results further suggest that trophic niche space has a pseudo-Euclidean geometry, meaning that link strength decays with distance in some dimensions of trophic niche space, while it increases with distance in other dimensions. Our analysis not only informs theory and modelling but may also be helpful for predicting trophic link strengths for pairs of other, similar species},

Here we focus on predicting drug response based on a cohort of genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiling data sets measured in human breast cancer cell lines. Through a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project, we analyzed a total of 44 drug sensitivity prediction algorithms. The top-performing approaches modeled nonlinear relationships and incorporated biological pathway information. We found that gene expression microarrays consistently provided the best predictive power of the individual profiling data sets; however, performance was increased by including multiple, independent data sets. We discuss the innovations underlying the top-performing methodology, Bayesian multitask MKL, and we provide detailed descriptions of all methods. This study establishes benchmarks for drug sensitivity prediction and identifies approaches that can be leveraged for the development of new methods.},

abstract = {Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. But because extent ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects, it is unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host–parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.

abstract = {The concept of function arises at all levels of biological study and is often loosely and variously defined, especially within ecology. This has led to ambiguity, obscuring the common structure that unites levels of biological organisation, from mol- ecules to ecosystems. Here we build on already successful ideas from molecular biology and complexity theory to create a precise definition of biological function which spans levels of biological organisation and can be quantified in the unifying currency of biomass, enabling comparisons of functional effectiveness (irrespective of the specific function) across the field of ecology. We give precise definitions of ecological and ecosystem function that bring clarity and precision to studies of biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships and questions of ecological redundancy. To illustrate the new concepts and their unifying power, we construct a simple community-level model with nutrient cycling and animal-plant mutualism, emphasising the importance of its network structure in determining overall functioning. This type of network structure is that of an autocatalytic set of functional relationships, which also appears at biochemical, cellular and organism levels of organisation, creating a nested hierarchy. This enables a common and unifying concept of function to apply from molecular interaction networks up to the global ecosystem.},

Different state-of-the-art tools for network inference use specific assumptions and simplifications to deal with underdetermination, and these influence the inferences. The outcome of network inference therefore varies between tools and can be highly complementary. Here we categorize the available tools according to the strategies that they use to deal with the problem of underdetermination.

abstract = {This work introduces a method to tune a sequence-based generative model for molecular de novo design that through augmented episodic likelihood can learn to generate structures with certain specified desirable properties. We demonstrate how this model can execute a range of tasks such as generating analogues to a query structure and generating compounds predicted to be active against a biological target. As a proof of principle, the model is first trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example, the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor D2, the model generates structures of which more than 95{\%} are predicted to be active, including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.},

@article{Flores2013,
abstract = {Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological life forms on Earth. However, relatively little is known regarding which bacteriophages infect and exploit which bacteria. A recent meta-analysis showed that empirically measured phage-bacteria infection networks are often significantly nested, on average, and not modular. A perfectly nested network is one in which phages can be ordered from specialist to generalist such that the host range of a given phage is a subset of the host range of the subsequent phage in the ordering. The same meta-analysis hypothesized that modularity, in which groups of phages specialize on distinct groups of hosts, should emerge at larger geographic and/or taxonomic scales. In this paper, we evaluate the largest known phage-bacteria interaction data set, representing the interaction of 215 phage types with 286 host types sampled from geographically separated sites in the Atlantic Ocean. We find that this interaction network is highly modular. In addition, some of the modules identified in this data set are nested or contain submodules, indicating the presence of multi-scale structure, as hypothesized in the earlier meta-analysis. We examine the role of geography in driving these patterns and find evidence that the host range of phages and the phage permissibility of bacteria is driven, in part, by geographic separation. We conclude by discussing approaches to disentangle the roles of ecology and evolution in driving complex patterns of interaction between phages and bacteria.},

abstract = {Biological named entity recognition, the identification of biological terms in text, is essential for biomedical information extraction. Machine learning-based approaches have been widely applied in this area. However, the recognition performance of current approaches could still be improved. Our novel approach is to combine support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), which can complement and facilitate each other. During the hybrid process, we use SVM to separate biological terms from non-biological terms, before we use CRFs to determine the types of biological terms, which makes full use of the power of SVM as a binary-class classifier and the data-labeling capacity of CRFs. We then merge the results of SVM and CRFs. To remove any inconsistencies that might result from the merging, we develop a useful algorithm and apply two rules. To ensure biological terms with a maximum length are identified, we propose a maximal bidirectional squeezing approach that finds the longest term. We also add a positive gain to rare events to reinforce their probability and avoid bias. Our approach will also gradually extend the context so more contextual information can be included. We examined the performance of four approaches with GENIA corpus and JNLPBA04 data. The combination of SVM and CRFs improved performance. The macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F(1) of the SVM-CRFs hybrid approach surpassed conventional SVM and CRFs. After applying the new algorithms, the macro-F1 reached 91.67{\%} with the GENIA corpus and 84.04{\%} with the JNLPBA04 data.},

We formally show that the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework is insufficient for solving MIPS, and then we extend the existing LSH framework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on an interesting mathematical phenomenon in which inner products, after independent asymmetric transformations, can be converted into the problem of approximate near neighbor search. This key observation makes efficient sublinear hashing scheme for MIPS possible. In the extended asymmetric LSH (ALSH) framework, we provide an explicit construction of provably fast hashing scheme for MIPS. The proposed construction and the extended LSH framework could be of independent theoretical interest. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement. We evaluate the method, for retrieving inner products, in the collaborative filtering task of item recommendations on Netflix and Movielens datasets.},

abstract = {The research of a generation of ecologists was catalysed by the recognition that the number and identity of species in communities influences the functioning of ecosystems. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is most often examined by controlling spe-cies richness and randomising community composition. In natural systems, biodiversity changes are often part of a bigger community assembly dynamic. Therefore, focusing on community assembly and the functioning of ecosystems (CAFE), by integrating both species richness and composition through species gains, losses and changes in abundance, will better reveal how com-munity changes affect ecosystem function. We synthesise the BEF and CAFE perspectives using an ecological application of the Price equation, which partitions the contributions of richness and composition to function. Using empirical examples, we show how the CAFE approach reveals important contributions of composition to function. These examples show how changes in species richness and composition driven by environmental perturbations can work in concert or antago-nistically to influence ecosystem function. Considering how communities change in an integrative fashion, rather than focusing on one axis of community structure at a time, will improve our abil-ity to anticipate and predict changes in ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are frequently used in biomedical informatics research to evaluate classification and prediction models for decision support, diagnosis, and prognosis. ROC analysis investigates the accuracy of a model's ability to separate positive from negative cases (such as predicting the presence or absence of disease), and the results are independent of the prevalence of positive cases in the study population. It is especially useful in evaluating predictive models or other tests that produce output values over a continuous range, since it captures the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity over that range. There are many ways to conduct an ROC analysis. The best approach depends on the experiment; an inappropriate approach can easily lead to incorrect conclusions. In this article, we review the basic concepts of ROC analysis, illustrate their use with sample calculations, make recommendations drawn from the literature, and list readily available software. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, it is both time-consuming and expensive to do so solely based on experiments due to the nature of the problem whose complexity is obviously overwhelming, just like the fact that "life is complicated". Therefore, developing computational techniques for predicting protein-protein interactions would be of significant value in this regard. By fusing the approach based on the gene ontology and the approach of pseudo-amino acid composition, a predictor called "GO-PseAA" predictor was established to deal with this problem. As a showcase, prediction was performed on 6323 protein pairs from yeast. To avoid redundancy and homology bias, none of the protein pairs investigated has {\textgreater} or = 40{\%} sequence identity with any other. The overall success rate obtained by jackknife cross-validation was 81.6{\%}, indicating the GO-PseAA predictor is very promising for predicting protein-protein interactions from protein sequences, and might become a useful vehicle for studying the network biology in the postgenomic era.},

This complex spectrum of interactions constitutes a network of links that mediates ecological com- munities' response to perturbations, such as exploitation and climate change. In the last decades, there have been great advances in the study of intricate ecological networks. We have, nonetheless, lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., “multiplex networks”), as well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statisticalmodeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full “entangled bank” of species looks like. The community exhibits clear multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly predictable from species traits. Moreover, dynamic simulations suggest that this non-randompatterning of how diverse non-trophic interactionsmap onto the food web could allow for higher species persistence and higher total biomass than expected by chance and tends to promote a higher robustness to extinctions.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demon-strated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions mod-els is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically exam-ine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models' ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predic-tors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.},

It uses a functional/phylogenetic system of classification, and currently encompasses about 5000 representative transporters and putative transporters in more than 500 families. We here describe novel software designed to support and extend the usefulness of TCDB. Our recent efforts render it more user friendly, incorporate machine learning to input novel data in a semiautomatic fashion, and allow analyses that are more accurate and less time consuming. The availability of these tools has resulted in recognition of distant phylogenetic relationships and tremendous expansion of the information available to TCDB users.},

We evaluate the hypothesis that this asymmetry results from the distribution of abundance among species, so that species interactions occur randomly among individuals. We used a database on mutualistic and antagonistic bipartite quantitative interaction networks. We show that across all types of networks asymmetry was correlated with abundance, so that rare species were asymmetrically affected by their abundant partners, while pairs of interacting abundant species tended to exhibit more symmetric, reciprocally strong effects. A null model shows that abundance provides a sufficient explanation of the asymmetry structure in some networks, but suggests the role of additional factors in others. Although not universal, our hypothesis holds for a substantial fraction of networks analyzed here, and should be considered as a null model in all studies aimed at evaluating the ecological and evolutionary consequences of species interactions.},

Second, sparse factorizations and Kronecker products are proving to be a very effective way to look at fast linear transforms. Researchers have taken the Kronecker methodology as developed for the fast Fourier transform and used it to build exciting alternatives.

abstract = {There is increasing world-wide concern about the impact of the introduction of exotic species on ecological communities. Since many exotic plants depend on native pollinators to successfully establish, it is of paramount importance that we understand precisely how exotic species integrate into existing plant-pollinator communities. In this manuscript, we have studied a global data base of empirical pollination networks to determine whether community, network, species or interaction characteristics can help identify invaded communities. We found that a limited number of community and network properties showed significant differences among the empirical data sets - namely networks with exotic plants present are characterized by greater total, plant and pollinator richness, as well as higher values of relative nestedness. We also observed significant differences in terms of the pollinators that interact with the exotic plants. In particular, we found that specialist pollinators that are also weak contributors to community nestedness are far more likely to interact with exotic plants than would be expected by chance alone. By virtue of their interactions, it appears that exotic plants may provide a key service to a community's specialist pollinators as well as fill otherwise vacant 'coevolutionary niches'.},

abstract = {The evolution of traits involved in ecological interactions such as predator-prey, host-parasite, and plant-pollinator interactions, are likely to be shaped by the phylogenetic history of both parties. We develop generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that estimate the effect of both parties' phylogenetic history on trait evolution, both in isolation but also in terms of how the two histories interact. Using data on the incidence and abundance of 206 flea species on 121 mammal species, we illustrate our method and compare it to previously used methods for detecting host-parasite coevolution. At large spatial scales we find that the phylogenetic interaction effect was substantial, indicating that related parasite species were more likely to be found on related host species. At smaller spatial scales, and when sampling effort was not controlled for, phylogenetic effects on the number and types of parasite species harbored by hosts were found to dominate. We go on to show that in situations where these additional phylogenetic effects exist, then previous methods have very high Type I error rates when testing for the phylogenetic interaction. Our GLMM method represents a robust and reliable approach to quantify the phylogenetic effects of traits determined by, or defined by, ecological interactions and has the advantage that it can easily be extended and interpreted in a broader context than existing permutation tests.},

abstract = {Understanding and predicting the dynamics of multispecies systems generally require estimates of interaction strength among species. Measuring interaction strength is difficult because of the large number of interactions in any natural system, long-term feedback, multiple pathways of effects between species pairs, and possible nonlinearities in interaction-strength functions. Presently, the few studies thatextensively estimate interaction strength suggest that distributions of interaction strength tend to be skewed toward few strong and many weak interactions. Modelling studies indicate that such skewed patterns tend to promote system stability and arise during assumbly of persistent communities. Methods for estimating interactions trength efficitenly from traits of organisms, such as allometric relationships, show some promise. Methods for estimating community response to environmental perturbations without an estimate of interaction strength may also be of use. Spatial and temporal scale may affect patterns of interaction strength, but these effects require further investigation and new multispecies modeling frameworks. Future progress will be aided by development of long-term multispecies time series of natural communities, by experimental tests of different methods for estimating interaction strength, and by increased understanding of nonlinear functional forms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural genomics projects such as the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) yield many new structures, but often these have no known molecular functions. One approach to recover this information is to use 3D templates - structure-function motifs that consist of a few functionally critical amino acids and may suggest functional similarity when geometrically matched to other structures. Since experimentally determined functional sites are not common enough to define 3D templates on a large scale, this work tests a computational strategy to select relevant residues for 3D templates. RESULTS: Based on evolutionary information and heuristics, an Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) pipeline built templates for 98 enzymes, half taken from the PSI, and sought matches in a non-redundant structure database. On average each template matched 2.7 distinct proteins, of which 2.0 share the first three Enzyme Commission digits as the template's enzyme of origin. In many cases (61{\%}) a single most likely function could be predicted as the annotation with the most matches, and in these cases such a plurality vote identified the correct function with 87{\%} accuracy. ETA was also found to be complementary to sequence homology-based annotations. When matches are required to both geometrically match the 3D template and to be sequence homologs found by BLAST or PSI-BLAST, the annotation accuracy is greater than either method alone, especially in the region of lower sequence identity where homology-based annotations are least reliable. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that knowledge of evolutionarily important residues improves functional annotation among distant enzyme homologs. Since, unlike other 3D template approaches, the ETA method bypasses the need for experimental knowledge of the catalytic mechanism, it should prove a useful, large scale, and general adjunct to combine with other methods to decipher protein function in the structural proteome.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Phenotypic data collected in breeding programs and marker-trait association studies are often analyzed by means of linear mixed models. In these models, the covariance between the genetic background effects of all genotypes under study is modeled by means of pairwise coefficients of coancestry. Several marker-based coancestry estimation procedures allow to estimate this covariance matrix, but generally introduce a certain amount of bias when the examined genotypes are part of a breeding program. CoCoa implements the most commonly used marker-based coancestry estimation procedures and as such, allows to select the best fitting covariance structure for the phenotypic data at hand. This better model fit translates into an increased power and improved type I error control in association studies and an improved accuracy in phenotypic prediction studies. The presented software package also provides an implementation of the new Weighted Alikeness in State (WAIS) estimator for use in hybrid breeding programs. Besides several matrix manipulation tools, CoCoa implements two different bending heuristics, in case the inverse of an ill-conditioned coancestry matrix estimate is needed. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software package CoCoa is freely available at http://webs.hogent.be/cocoa. Source code, manual, binaries for 32 and 64-bit Linux systems and an installer for Microsoft Windows are provided. The core components of CoCoa are written in C++, while the graphical user interface is written in Java.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders is usually based on invasive techniques such as endo-scopy. A key important factor in GI cancer is early diagnosis which warrants development of non-or less-invasive diagnostic techniques. In addition, monitoring and surveillance are other important parts in the mana-gement of GI diseases. Metabolomics studies with nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry can measure the concentration of more than 3000 chemical compounds in the urine providing possible chemical signature in different diseases and during health. In this review, we discuss the urinary metabolomics signa-ture of different GI diseases including GI cancer and elaborate on how these biomarkers could be used for the classification, early diagnosis and the monitoring of the patients. Moreover, we discuss future directions of this still evolving field of research. Core tip: Scientists are always searching for new disease biomarkers. An acceptable biomarker could help us in early diagnosis and classification of the diseases as well as the prediction of disease outcome. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases is usually based on techniques such as upper or lower GI endoscopy, while highly sensitive and specific non-invasive diagnostic or screening tools are usually lacking. In this review, we have discussed the potentials of urinary metabolomics study as a future tool for the screening, diagnosis, classi-fication and surveillance of GI diseases including inflam-matory bowel disease and cancer.},

@article{Milns2010,
abstract = {Understanding functional relationships within ecological networks can help reveal keys to ecosystem stability or fragility. Revealing these relationships is complicated by the difficulties of isolating variables or performing experimental manipulations within a natural ecosystem, and thus inferences are often made by matching models to observational data. Such models, however, require assumptions-or detailed measurements-of parameters such as birth and death rate, encounter frequency, territorial exclusion, and predation success. Here, we evaluate the use of a Bayesian network inference algorithm, which can reveal ecological networks based upon species and habitat abundance alone. We test the algorithm's performance and applicability on observational data of avian communities and habitat in the Peak District National Park, United Kingdom. The resulting networks correctly reveal known relationships among habitat types and known interspecific relationships. In addition, the networks produced novel insights into ecosystem structure and identified key species with high connectivity. Thus, Bayesian networks show potential for becoming a valuable tool in ecosystem analysis.},

abstract = {Ecologists are fascinated by the prevalence of nestedness in biogeographic and community data, where it is thought to promote biodiversity in mutualistic systems. Traditionally, nestedness has been treated in a binary sense: species and their interactions are either present or absent, neglecting information on abundances and interaction frequencies. Extending nestedness to quantitative data facilitates the study of species preferences, and we propose a new detection method that follows from a basic property of bipartite networks: large dominant eigenvalues are associated with highly nested configurations. We show that complex ecological networks are binary nested, but quantitative preferences are non-nested, indicating limited consumer overlap of favoured resources. The spectral graph approach provides a formal link to local dynamical stability analysis, where we demonstrate that nested mutualistic structures are minimally stable. We conclude that, within the binary constraint of interaction plausibility, species preferences are partitioned to avoid competition, thereby benefiting system-wide resource allocation.},

abstract = {The links between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning remain highly controversial. There is a growing consensus, however, that functional diversity, or the value and range of species traits, rather than species numbers per se, strongly determines ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, and the fact that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate, functional diversity has been studied in relatively few cases. Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Predictions of interactions between target proteins and potential leads are of great benefit in the drug discovery process. We present a comprehensively applicable statistical prediction method for interactions between any proteins and chemical compounds, which requires only protein sequence data and chemical structure data and utilizes the statistical learning method of support vector machines. In order to realize reasonable comprehensive predictions which can involve many false positives, we propose two approaches for reduction of false positives: (i) efficient use of multiple statistical prediction models in the framework of two-layer SVM and (ii) reasonable design of the negative data to construct statistical prediction models. In two-layer SVM, outputs produced by the first-layer SVM models, which are constructed with different negative samples and reflect different aspects of classifications, are utilized as inputs to the second-layer SVM. In order to design negative data which produce fewer false positive predictions, we iteratively construct SVM models or classification boundaries from positive and tentative negative samples and select additional negative sample candidates according to pre-determined rules. Moreover, in order to fully utilize the advantages of statistical learning methods, we propose a strategy to effectively feedback experimental results to computational predictions with consideration of biological effects of interest. We show the usefulness of our approach in predicting potential ligands binding to human androgen receptors from more than 19 million chemical compounds and verifying these predictions by in vitro binding. Moreover, we utilize this experimental validation as feedback to enhance subsequent computational predictions, and experimentally validate these predictions again. This efficient procedure of the iteration of the in silico prediction and in vitro or in vivo experimental verifications with the sufficient feedback enabled us to identify novel ligand candidates which were distant from known ligands in the chemical space.},

@article{Tang2016,
abstract = {We study the problem of visualizing large-scale and high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional (typically 2D or 3D) space. Much success has been reported recently by techniques that first compute a similarity structure of the data points and then project them into a low-dimensional space with the structure preserved. These two steps suffer from considerable computational costs, preventing the state-of-the-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling to large-scale and high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of data points and hundreds of dimensions). We propose the LargeVis, a technique that first constructs an accurately approximated K-nearest neighbor graph from the data and then layouts the graph in the low-dimensional space. Comparing to t-SNE, LargeVis significantly reduces the computational cost of the graph construction step and employs a principled probabilistic model for the visualization step, the objective of which can be effectively optimized through asynchronous stochastic gradient descent with a linear time complexity. The whole procedure thus easily scales to millions of high-dimensional data points. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the LargeVis outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. The hyper-parameters of LargeVis are also much more stable over different data sets.},

It maps the original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node at-tributes capture topological and label information. A family of kernels can be defined based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efficient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classification benchmark data sets in terms of accu-racy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.},

Its use can substantially reduce prediction errors when there are correlations between responses while maintaining accuracy even if the responses are uncorrelated. In extensive simulations, the new procedure is compared with several previously proposed methods for predicting multiple responses (including partial least squares) and exhibits superior accuracy.

We show here that this technique can be used directly on the surface of food to produce biochemically interpretable “fingerprints.” Spoilage in meat is the result of decomposition and the formation of metabolites caused by the growth and enzymatic activity of microorgan- isms. FT-IR was exploited to measure biochemical changes within the meat substrate, enhancing and accel- erating the detection of microbial spoilage. Chicken breasts were purchased from a national retailer, commi- nuted for 10 s, and left to spoil at room temperature for 24 h. Every hour, FT-IR measurements were taken directly from the meat surface using attenuated total reflectance, and the total viable counts were obtained by classical plating methods. Quantitative interpretation of FT-IR spectra was possible using partial least- squares regression and allowed accurate estimates of bacterial loads to be calculated directly from the meat surface in 60 s. Genetic programming was used to derive rules showing that at levels of 107 bacteria{\textperiodcentered}g?1 the main biochemical indicator of spoilage was the onset of proteolysis. Thus, using FT-IR we were able to acquire a metabolic snapshot and quantify, noninvasively, the microbial loads of food samples accurately and rapidly in 60 s, directly from the sample surface. We believe this approach will aid in the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point process for the assessment of the microbiological safety of food at the production, processing, manufacturing, packaging, and storage levels.

By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {Geometric objects are often represented approximately in terms of a finite set of points in three-dimensional euclidean space. In this paper, we extend this representation to what we call labeled point clouds. A labeled point cloud is a finite set of points, where each point is not only associated with a position in three-dimensional space, but also with a discrete class label that represents a specific property. This type of model is especially suitable for modeling biomolecules such as proteins and protein binding sites, where a label may represent an atom type or a physico-chemical property. Proceeding from this representation, we address the question of how to compare two labeled points clouds in terms of their similarity. Using fuzzy modeling techniques, we develop a suitable similarity measure as well as an efficient evolutionary algorithm to compute it. Moreover, we consider the problem of establishing an alignment of the structures in the sense of a one-to-one correspondence between their basic constituents. From a biological point of view, alignments of this kind are of great interest, since mutually corresponding molecular constituents offer important information about evolution and heredity, and can also serve as a means to explain a degree of similarity. In this paper, we therefore develop a method for computing pairwise or multiple alignments of labeled point clouds. To this end, we proceed from an optimal superposition of the corresponding point clouds and construct an alignment which is as much as possible in agreement with the neighborhood structure established by this superposition. We apply our methods to the structural analysis of protein binding sites.},

abstract = {We study the problem of structured output learning from a regression perspective. We first provide a general formulation of the ker-nel dependency estimation (KDE) approach to this problem using operator-valued ker-nels. Our formulation overcomes the two main limitations of the original KDE ap-proach, namely the decoupling between out-puts in the image space and the inability to use a joint feature space. We then propose a covariance-based operator-valued kernel that allows us to take into account the structure of the kernel feature space. This kernel op-erates on the output space and only encodes the interactions between the outputs with-out any reference to the input space. To ad-dress this issue, we introduce a variant of our KDE method based on the conditional covari-ance operator that in addition to the correla-tion between the outputs takes into account the effects of the input variables. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our KDE ap-proach on three structured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the-art kernel-based structured output regression methods.},

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear au- toencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoen- coder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections},

The efficiency may be further enhanced because gcForest is naturally apt to parallel implementation.

abstract = {A new method has been developed to detect functional relationships among proteins independent of a given sequence or fold homology. It is based on the idea that protein function is intimately related to the recognition and subsequent response to the binding of a substrate or an endogenous ligand in a well-characterized binding pocket. Thus, recognition of similar ligands, supposedly linked to similar function, requires conserved recognition features exposed in terms of common physicochemical interaction properties via the functional groups of the residues flanking a particular binding cavity. Following a technique commonly used in the comparison of small molecule ligands, generic pseudocenters coding for possible interaction properties were assigned for a large sample set of cavities extracted from the entire PDB and stored in the database Cavbase. Using a particular query cavity a series of related cavities of decreasing similarity is detected based on a clique detection algorithm. The detected similarity is ranked according to property-based surface patches shared in common by the different clique solutions. The approach either retrieves protein cavities accommodating the same (e.g. co-factors) or closely related ligands or it extracts proteins exhibiting similar function in terms of a related catalytic mechanism. Finally the new method has strong potential to suggest alternative molecular skeletons in de novo design. The retrieval of molecular building blocks accommodated in a particular sub-pocket that shares similarity with the pocket in a protein studied by drug design can inspire the discovery of novel ligands.},

Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links.

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.

@article{Ruan2018,
abstract = {Background: Since many proteins become functional only after they interact with their partner proteins and form protein complexes, it is essential to identify the sets of proteins that form complexes. Therefore, several computational methods have been proposed to predict complexes from the topology and structure of experimental protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. These methods work well to predict complexes involving at least three proteins, but generally fail at identifying complexes involving only two different proteins, called heterodimeric complexes or heterodimers. There is however an urgent need for efficient methods to predict heterodimers, since the majority of known protein complexes are precisely heterodimers. Results: In this paper, we use three promising kernel functions, Min kernel and two pairwise kernels, which are Metric Learning Pairwise Kernel (MLPK) and Tensor Product Pairwise Kernel (TPPK). We also consider the normalization forms of Min kernel. Then, we combine Min kernel or its normalization form and one of the pairwise kernels by plugging. We applied kernels based on PPI, domain, phylogenetic profile, and subcellular localization properties to predicting heterodimers. Then, we evaluate our method by employing C-Support Vector Classification (C-SVC), carrying out 10-fold cross-validation, and calculating the average F-measures. The results suggest that the combination of normalized-Min-kernel and MLPK leads to the best F-measure and improved the performance of our previous work, which had been the best existing method so far. Conclusions: We propose new methods to predict heterodimers, using a machine learning-based approach. We train a support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate interacting vs non-interacting protein pairs, based on informations extracted from PPI, domain, phylogenetic profiles and subcellular localization. We evaluate in detail new kernel functions to encode these data, and report prediction performance that outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps provide insight into cellular biology and have received considerable attention in the post-genomic era. While large-scale experimental approaches have generated large collections of experimentally determined PPIs, technical limitations preclude certain PPIs from detection. Recently, we demonstrated that yeast PPIs can be computationally predicted using re-occurring short polypeptide sequences between known interacting protein pairs. However, the computational requirements and low specificity made this method unsuitable for large-scale investigations. Here, we report an improved approach, which exhibits a specificity of approximately 99.95{\%} and executes 16,000 times faster. Importantly, we report the first all-to-all sequence-based computational screen of PPIs in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which we identify 29,589 high confidence interactions of approximately 2 x 10(7) possible pairs. Of these, 14,438 PPIs have not been previously reported and may represent novel interactions. In particular, these results reveal a richer set of membrane protein interactions, not readily amenable to experimental investigations. From the novel PPIs, a novel putative protein complex comprised largely of membrane proteins was revealed. In addition, two novel gene functions were predicted and experimentally confirmed to affect the efficiency of non-homologous end-joining, providing further support for the usefulness of the identified PPIs in biological investigations.},

abstract = {The development of new high-throughput technologies enables us to measure genome-wide transcription levels, protein abundance, metabolite concentration, etc. Nevertheless, these experimental data are often noisy and incomplete, which hinders data analysis, modeling and prediction. Here, we propose a method to predict expression values of genes involved in stable cellular phenotypes from the expression values of the remaining genes in a literature-based gene regulatory network. The consistency between predicted and known stable states from experimental data is used to guide an iterative network pruning that contextualizes the network to the biological conditions under which the expression data were obtained. Using the contextualized network and the property of network stability we predict gene expression values missing from experimental data. The prediction method assumes a Boolean model to compute steady states of networks and an evolutionary algorithm to iteratively prune the networks. The evolutionary algorithm samples the probability distribution of positive feedback loops or positive circuits and individual interactions within the subpopulation of the best-pruned networks at each iteration. The resulting expression inference is based not only on previous knowledge about local connectivity but also on a global network property (stability), providing robustness in the predictions.},

Special cases of this problem include collaborative filtering and link prediction. We present a new {\{}log-linear{\}} model for dyadic prediction that is the first to satisfy several important desiderata: (i) labels may be ordinal or nominal, (ii) side-information can be easily exploited if present, (iii) with or without side-information, latent features are inferred for dyad members, (iv) the model is resistant to sample-selection bias, (v) it can learn well-calibrated probabilities, and (vi) it can scale to large datasets. To our knowledge, no existing method satisfies all the above criteria. In particular, many methods assume that the labels are binary or numerical, and cannot use side-information. Experimental results show that the new method is competitive with previous specialized methods for collaborative filtering and link prediction. Other experimental results demonstrate that the new method succeeds for dyadic prediction tasks where previous methods cannot be used. In particular, the new method predicts nominal labels accurately, and by using side-information it solves the cold-start problem in collaborative filtering.},

Here we argue that genomic data can be integrated into the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics in ways that deepen our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution. Specifically, we outline five major questions in the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics for which genomic data may provide answers. Although genomic data alone will not be sufficient to resolve these challenges, integrating genomic data can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of phenotypic change, help elucidate the mechanisms driving eco-evolutionary dynamics, and lead to more accurate evolutionary predictions of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.},

MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships.

abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly interested in predicting how intraspecific variation and changing trait values impact species interactions and community compo-sition. For many traits, much of this variation is caused by phenotypic plasticity, and thus the impact of plasticity on species coexistence deserves robust quantification. Partly due to a lack of sound theoretical expectations, empirical studies make contradictory claims regarding plasticity effects on coexistence. Our critical review of this literature, framed in modern coexistence theory, reveals that plasticity affects species interactions in ways that could impact stabilizing niche differences and competitive asymmetries. However, almost no study integrates these measures to quantify the net effect of plasticity on species coexistence. To address this challenge, we outline novel empirical approaches grounded in modern theory. The Importance of Phenotypic Plasticity for Species Coexistence Ecologists are increasingly interested in predicting how species' trait values and phenotypic variation impact species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem function [1–3]. Trait-based ecology is identifying the multifarious impacts of trait-mediated direct and indirect interactions between species on community dynamics [4–6]. Meanwhile, ecologists are increas-ingly emphasizing the importance of variation within species in influencing ecological processes. A recent meta-analysis reveals that approximately one-fourth of the total trait variation within plant communities is due to variation within species [2]. How this intraspecific variation drives ecological dynamics remains an important open question [1,7,8]. In fact, the ecological con-sequences of genetically based intraspecific variation coupled to rapid evolution in species traits has blossomed into its own subfield of eco-evolutionary dynamics [9–11]. Nonetheless, for a number of traits, a large fraction of the spatial and temporal changes in species' mean trait values, as well as trait variation within species at a single place and time, is likely attributable to phenotypic plasticity. Thus, an important next challenge in trait-based ecology is to understand the role of phenotypic plasticity in mediating species interactions. Phenotypic plasticity occurs when a genotype expresses different phenotypes in different environments [12], summarized in Box 1. The conditions that select for plasticity as well as how it mediates adaptive evolution have long been the subject of considerable interest [12–16]. In this review, we aim to bring greater attention to the ecological impacts of plasticity caused by competitive interactions, with particular focus on how plasticity mediates species coexistence. We focus on competitive interactions as they dictate many of the most important processes in community and ecosystem ecology [17,18], and are well known to induce phenotypic changes [19,20]. Examples include diet shifts in tadpoles from omnivory to carnivory [21], transformation of locusts from solitary to gregarious forms [22], elongation of aboveground plant shoots [23], and diet and behavioral shifts in many taxa [20,24–27]. Studies examining the impact of plasticity on species coexistence date back many decades, especially in animal behavioral ecology [28,29] and root foraging behavior of plants – reviewed in [30]. Yet, most of this literature},

Hence, there is a strong demand for the development of a novel theoretical method to identify potential interaction between drug and target protein.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We use all known proteins and drugs to construct a nodes-and edges-weighted biological relevant interactome network. On the basis of the "guilt-by-association" principle, novel network topology features are proposed to characterize interaction pairs and random forest algorithm is employed to identify potential drug-protein interaction. Accuracy of 92.53{\%} derived from the 10-fold cross-validation is about 10{\%} higher than that of the existing method. We identify 2,272 potential drug-target interactions, some of which are associated with diseases, such as Torg-Winchester syndrome and rhabdomyosarcoma. The proposed method can not only accurately predict the interaction between drug molecule and target protein, but also help disease treatment and drug discovery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACTS: zhanchao8052@gmail.com; ceszxy@mail.sysu.edu.cn SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

As a concrete example, we present recently developed inference methods from the field of protein contact prediction and show that a basic set of assumptions leads to similar solution strategies for inferring the model parameters in both variable types. These parameters reflect interactive couplings between observables, which can be used to predict global properties of the biological system. Such methods are applicable to the important problems of protein 3-D structure prediction and association of gene-gene networks, and they enable potential applications to the analysis of gene alteration patterns and to protein design.},

We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.},

In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives.},

abstract = {With the widespread use of information technologies, information networks have increasingly become popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, telecommunication networks, and biological networks. Analyzing these networks sheds light on different aspects of social life such as the structure of society, information diffusion, and different patterns of communication. However, the large scale of information networks often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive and intractable. Recently, network representation learning has been proposed as a new learning paradigm that embeds network vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In this survey, we perform a thorough review of the current literature on network representation learning in the field of data mining and machine learning. We propose a new categorization to analyze and summarize state-of-the-art network representation learning techniques according to the methodology they employ and the network information they preserve. Finally, to facilitate research on this topic, we summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation methodologies, and discuss open issues and future research directions in this field.},

If the point set has a bounded expansion constant c, which is a measure of the intrinsic dimensionality, as defined in (Karger {\&} Ruhl, 2002), the cover tree data structure can be constructed in O (c6n log n) time. Furthermore, nearest neighbor queries require time only logarithmic in n, in particular O (c12 log n) time.

abstract = {One major task in molecular biology is to understand the dependency among genes to model gene regulatory networks. Pearson's correlation is the most common method used to measure dependence between gene expression signals, but it works well only when data are linearly associated. For other types of association, such as non-linear or non-functional relationships, methods based on the concepts of rank correlation and information theory-based measures are more adequate than the Pearson's correlation, but are less used in applications, most probably because of a lack of clear guidelines for their use. This work seeks to summarize the main methods (Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's correlations; distance correlation; Hoeffding's D measure; Heller-Heller-Gorfine measure; mutual information and maximal information coefficient) used to identify dependency between random variables, especially gene expression data, and also to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each method. Systematic Monte Carlo simulation analyses ranging from sample size, local dependence and linear/non-linear and also non-functional relationships are shown. Moreover, comparisons in actual gene expression data are carried out. Finally, we provide a suggestive list of methods that can be used for each type of data set.},

abstract = {In the past decades, various protein subcellular-location (SCL) predictors have been developed. Most of these predictors, like TMHMM 2.0, SignalP 3.0, PrediSi and Phobius, aim at the identification of one or a few SCLs, whereas others such as CELLO and Psortb.v.2.0 aim at a broader classification. Although these tools and pipelines can achieve a high precision in the accurate prediction of signal peptides and transmembrane helices, they have a much lower accuracy when other sequence characteristics are concerned. For instance, it proved notoriously difficult to identify the fate of proteins carrying a putative type I signal peptidase (SPIase) cleavage site, as many of those proteins are retained in the cell membrane as N-terminally anchored membrane proteins. Moreover, most of the SCL classifiers are based on the classification of the Swiss-Prot database and consequently inherited the inconsistency of that SCL classification. As accurate and detailed SCL prediction on a genome scale is highly desired by experimental researchers, we decided to construct a new SCL prediction pipeline: LocateP.},

abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon ? /Wiener and Gini /Simpson ? indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S{\o}rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita -Horn index as special cases. What},

abstract = {1 1. There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between 2 species vary in space and time. Yet, our current numerical framework to analyze the 3 structure of interactions, largely based on graph-theoretical approaches, is unsuited to 4 this type of data. Since the variation of species interactions holds much information, 5 there is a need to develop new metrics to exploit it. 6 2. We present analytical expressions of key network metrics, using a probabilistic frame-7 work. Our approach is based on modeling each interaction as a Bernoulli event, and 8 using basic calculus to express the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, 9 its variance. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. 10 3. We show that our approach allows to overcome limitations of both neglecting the vari-11 ation of interactions (over-estimation of rare events) and using simulations (extremely 12 high computational demand). We present a few case studies that highlight how these 13 measures can be used. 14 4. We conclude this contribution by discussing how the sampling and data representa-15 tion of ecological network can be adapted to better allow the application of a fully 16 probabilistic numerical framework.},

All species pairs are connected by an arrow from the inferior to the superior. Using game theory, we show how the equilibrium density of all species can be derived from the structure of the network.

As a concrete example, we present recently developed inference methods from the field of protein contact prediction and show that a basic set of assumptions leads to similar solution strategies for inferring the model parameters in both variable types. These parameters reflect interactive couplings between observables, which can be used to predict global properties of the biological system. Such methods are applicable to the important problems of protein 3-D structure prediction and association of gene-gene networks, and they enable potential applications to the analysis of gene alteration patterns and to protein design.},

The increased avail-ability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and math-ematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of net-work structure in biological systems. Although tra-ditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks.},

This paper reports on assessing and improving complex system resilience using distributed redundancy, termed degeneracy in biological systems, to endow large-scale complicated computer systems with the same robustness that emerges in complex biological and natural systems. However, in order to promote an evolutionary approach, through emergent self-organisation, it is necessary to specify the systems in an ‘open-ended' manner where not all states of the system are prescribed at design-time. In particular an observer system is used to select robust topologies, within system components, based on a measurement of the first non-zero Eigen value in the Laplacian spectrum of the components' network graphs; also known as the algebraic connectivity. It is shown, through experimentation on a simulation, that increasing the average algebraic connectivity across the components, in a network, leads to an increase in the variety of individual components termed distributed redundancy; the capacity for structurally distinct components to perform an identical function in a particular context. The results are applied to a specific application where active clustering of like services is used to aid load balancing in a highly distributed network. Using the described procedure is shown to improve performance and distribute redundancy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a method, termed the Interaction Distribution (ID) method, for analysis of quantitative ecological network data. In many cases, quantitative network data sets are under-sampled, i.e. many interactions are poorly sampled or remain unobserved. Hence, the output of statistical analyses may fail to differentiate between patterns that are statistical artefacts and those which are real characteristics of ecological networks. The ID method can support assessment and inference of under-sampled ecological network data. In the current paper, we illustrate and discuss the ID method based on the properties of plant-animal pollination data sets of flower visitation frequencies. However, the ID method may be applied to other types of ecological networks. The method can supplement existing network analyses based on two definitions of the underlying probabilities for each combination of pollinator and plant species: (1), pi,j: the probability for a visit made by the i'th pollinator species to take place on the j'th plant species; (2), qi,j: the probability for a visit received by the j'th plant species to be made by the i'th pollinator. The method applies the Dirichlet distribution to estimate these two probabilities, based on a given empirical data set. The estimated mean values for pi,j and qi,j reflect the relative differences between recorded numbers of visits for different pollinator and plant species, and the estimated uncertainty of pi,j and qi,j decreases with higher numbers of recorded visits.},

abstract = {The application of information theory (IT) to ecology has occurred along two separate lines: (1) it has been used to quantify the distribution of stocks and numbers of organisms; and (2) it has been employed to quantify the pattern of interactions of trophic processes. By and large, the first endeavor has resulted in relatively few insights into ecosystem dynamics and has generated much ambiguity and disappointment, so that most ecologists remain highly skeptical about the advisability of applying IT to ecology. By contrast, the second, and less well-known application has shed light on the possibility that ecosystem behavior is the most palpable example of a purely natural ‘infodynamics' that transcends classical dynamics, but remains well within the realm of quantitative description.},

abstract = {The evolution of traits involved in ecological interactions such as predator-prey, host-parasite, and plant-pollinator interactions, are likely to be shaped by the phylogenetic history of both parties. We develop generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that estimate the effect of both parties' phylogenetic history on trait evolution, both in isolation but also in terms of how the two histories interact. Using data on the incidence and abundance of 206 flea species on 121 mammal species, we illustrate our method and compare it to previously used methods for detecting host-parasite coevolution. At large spatial scales we find that the phylogenetic interaction effect was substantial, indicating that related parasite species were more likely to be found on related host species. At smaller spatial scales, and when sampling effort was not controlled for, phylogenetic effects on the number and types of parasite species harbored by hosts were found to dominate. We go on to show that in situations where these additional phylogenetic effects exist, then previous methods have very high Type I error rates when testing for the phylogenetic interaction. Our GLMM method represents a robust and reliable approach to quantify the phylogenetic effects of traits determined by, or defined by, ecological interactions and has the advantage that it can easily be extended and interpreted in a broader context than existing permutation tests.},

abstract = {Plant–animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant–pollinator and 24 plant–frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant–animal mutualistic networks (65.6{\%}) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2{\%}) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant–animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.},

abstract = {Network analyses of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species are very popular, but their biological interpretations are often unclear and incautious. Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either(1)niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or(2)impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host–parasitoid or plant–animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as ‘specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that ‘dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species ‘depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology. Mutualistische oder antagonistische Beziehungen zwischen Arten einer Gemeinschaft werden derzeit h{\"{a}}ufig mit Hilfe von Netzwerkanalysen beschrieben. Da die biologische Deutung solcher Analysen oft missverst{\"{a}}ndlich ist, wird in diesem Artikel vorgeschlagen, zwei Interpretationsarten zu unterscheiden:(1){\"{O}}kologische Nische, z.B. Spezialisierung, Nischenbreite und {\"{u}}berlappung, sowie Kompatibilit{\"{a}}t von Merkmalen zwischen Arten.(2)Interaktionseffekte, die von der relativen H{\"{a}}ufigkeit der Wechselwirkungen abh{\"{a}}ngig sind, z.B. Pr{\"{a}}dations- und Infektionsraten oder mutualistische Funktionen. Bei nischenbezogenen Deutungen von Netzwerken, die auf beobachteten Interaktionen basieren, muss jedoch ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden, dass die Gesamtzahl der Beobachtungen pro Art limitiert ist und sich zwischen Arten stark unterscheidet. Allein diese Variation kann viele Netzwerkmuster erkl{\"{a}}ren, beispielsweise “Nestedness”, was oft als asymmetrische Spezialisierung missverstanden wurde. Hier wird analytisch bewiesen, dass eine mutma{\ss}liche “Spezialisierungs-Asymmetrie” zwischen zwei Arten allein auf deren unterschiedliche Beobachtungsh{\"{a}}ufigkeit zur{\"{u}}ckgef{\"{u}}hrt werden kann. Unhabh{\"{a}}ngig erhobene Daten f{\"{u}}r beide Arten sind notwendig, um diesen Trugschluss zu vermeiden. Das Aussterben von Arten durch Verlust des Assoziationspartners (Koextinktion) wurde in mehreren publizierten Studien modelliert. Solche Simulationen basieren auf der Annahme, dass jede Art von seinen beobachteten Assoziationspartnern abh{\"{a}}ngig ist (nischenbasierte Deutung). Hier kann jedoch gezeigt werden, dass vor allem solche Arten scheinbar gef{\"{a}}hrdet sind, die nur ein- oder wenige Male beobachtet wurden, also nicht notwendigerweise Spezialisten darstellen. Die explizite Unterscheidung zwischen nischen- und effektbasierter Interpretation k{\"{o}}nnte demnach eine hilfreiche konzeptionelle Br{\"{u}}cke darstellen, um Netzwerkanalysen und klassische Gemeinschafts{\"{o}}kologie zusammenzuf{\"{u}}hren.},

abstract = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability [1-6]. However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7-9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A recent meta-analysis of meta-analyses by M{\o}ller and Jennions suggested that ecologists using statistical models are explaining between 2.5{\%} and 5.42{\%} of the variability in ecological studies. Although we agree that there is considerable variability in ecological systems that is not explained, we disagree with the approach and general conclusions of M{\o}ller and Jennions. As an alternate perspective, we explored the question: "How much ecological variation in relationships is not explained?" We did this by examining published studies in five different journals representative of the numerous sub-disciplines of ecology. We quantified the proportion of variance not explained in statistical models as the residual or random error compared to the total variation in the data set. Our results indicate that statistical models explain roughly half of the variation in variables of interest, vastly different from the 2.5{\%}-5.42{\%} reported by M{\o}ller and Jennions. This difference resulted largely from a different level of analysis: we considered the original study to be the appropriate level for quantifying variability while M{\o}ller and Jennions combined studies at different temporal and spatial scales and attempted to find universal single-factor relationships between ecological variables across study organisms or locations. Therefore, we believe that M{\o}ller and Jennions actually measured the universality of single factor effects across multiple ecological systems, not the amount of variability in ecological studies explained by ecologists. This study, combined with M{\o}ller and Jennions', illustrates importance of applying statistical models appropriately to assess ecological relationships.},

We placed heavy emphasis on algal and macroinvertebrate taxonomy, identifying most taxa to species or morpho-species level. Food-web attributes were derived from symmetrical matrices using an Excel macro. The values of the food-web attributes are generally consistent with generalities that have previously been reported in food-web studies, although some hypothesisied relationships between connectance and food-web size did not hold. The patterns detected were robust to the inclusion or exclusion of species that were identified in gut contents but not in field samples. The attributes strongly reflected the trophic status of the streams. Dempsters Creek was classified as autotrophic (based on high primary production and a high ratio of production to respiration) and displayed a larger food-web size and longer food-chains than those seen in Healy Creek, which was classified as hetero-trophic (lower primary production and production to respiration ratio). The importance of dynamic environmental attributes such as production and disturbance in structuring food-webs is emphasised in this study.},

These findings offer a new null model for the most probable degree distributions in food webs and other networks. They suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring generalist or specialist consumption strategies but that biological drivers or methodological bias may force the consumer distribution away from the MaxEnt form.},

abstract = {We develop two tools to analyze the behavior of multiple-class, or multi-class, classifiers by means of entropic measures on their confusion matrix or contingency table. First we obtain a balance equation on the entropies that captures interesting properties of the classifier. Second, by normalizing this balance equation we first obtain a 2-simplex in a three-dimensional entropy space and then the de Finetti entropy diagram or entropy triangle. We also give examples of the assessment of classifiers with these tools.},

abstract = {For more than a century, scientists have investigated the natural history of plague, a highly fatal disease caused by infection with the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis. Among their most important discoveries were the zoonotic nature of the disease and that plague exists in natural cycles involving transmission between rodent hosts and flea vectors. Other significant findings include those on the evolution of Y. pestis; geographic variation among plague strains; the dynamics and maintenance of transmission cycles; mechanisms by which fleas transmit Y. pestis; resistance and susceptibility among plague hosts; the structure and typology of natural foci; and how landscape features influence the focality, maintenance, and spread of the disease. The knowledge gained from these studies is essential for the development of effective prevention and control strategies},

@book{MacKay2005,
abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

abstract = {Ecologists often believe the discovery of mechanism to be the central goal of scientific research. While many macroecologists have inherited this view, to date they have been much more efficient at producing patterns than identifying their underlying processes. We discuss several possible attitudes for macroecologists to adopt in this context while also arguing that in fact macroecology already has many mechanisms that are ignored. We briefly describe six of these: central limit theorem, fractals, random sampling and placement, neutral theory (and descendents), concordance of forces, and maximum entropy. We explore why these mechanisms are overlooked and discuss whether they should be. We conclude that macroecology needs to take a more pragmatic, less ideological approach to mechanism. We apply this viewpoint to the recent controversy over maximum entropy and suggest that maximum entropy needs to be viewed more pragmatically and less ideologically.},

abstract = {Ecological networks are complexes of interacting species, but not all potential links among species are realized. Unobserved links are either missing or forbidden. Missing links exist, but require more sampling or alternative ways of detection to be verified. Forbidden links remain unobservable, irrespective of sampling effort. They are caused by linkage constraints. We studied one Arctic pollination network and two Mediterranean seed-dispersal networks. In the first, for example, we recorded flower-visit links for one full season, arranged data in an interaction matrix and got a connectance C of 15 per cent. Interaction accumulation curves documented our sampling of interactions through observation of visits to be robust. Then, we included data on pollen from the body surface of flower visitors as an additional link 'currency'. This resulted in 98 new links, missing from the visitation data. Thus, the combined visit-pollen matrix got an increased C of 20 per cent. For the three networks, C ranged from 20 to 52 per cent, and thus the percentage of unobserved links (100 - C) was 48 to 80 per cent; these were assumed forbidden because of linkage constraints and not missing because of under-sampling. Phenological uncoupling (i.e. non-overlapping phenophases between interacting mutualists) is one kind of constraint, and it explained 22 to 28 per cent of all possible, but unobserved links. Increasing phenophase overlap between species increased link probability, but extensive overlaps were required to achieve a high probability. Other kinds of constraint, such as size mismatch and accessibility limitations, are briefly addressed.},

abstract = {Food-web descriptors serve as a means for among-web comparisons that are necessary for the discovery of regularities in respect to food-web structure. Qualitative descriptors were however found to be highly sensitive to varying levels of sampling effort. To circumvent these shortcomings, quantitative counterparts were proposed which take the magnitude of trophic interaction between species into consideration. For 14 properties we examined the performance with increasing sampling effort of a qualitative, an unweighted quantitative (giving the same weight to each taxon), and a weighted quantitative version (weighing each taxon by the amount of incoming and outgoing flows). The evaluation of 10 extensively documented quantitative webs formed the basis for this analysis. The quantitative versions were found to be much more robust against variable sampling effort. This increase in accuracy is accomplished at the cost of a slight decrease in precision as compared to the qualitative properties. Conversely, the quantitative descriptors also proved less sensitive to differences in evenness in the distribution of link magnitude. By more adequately incorporating the information inherent to quantitative food-web compilations, quantitative descriptors are able to better represent the web, and are thus more suitable for the elucidation of general trends in food-web structure.},

abstract = {A biological system is robust to mutations if it continues to function after genetic changes in its parts. Such robustness is pervasive on different levels of biological organization, from macromolecules to genetic networks and whole organisms. I here ask which of two possible causes of such robustness are more important on a genome-wide scale, for systems whose parts are genes, such as metabolic and genetic networks. The first of the two causes is redundancy of a system's parts: A gene may be dispensable if the genome contains redundant, back-up copies of the gene. The second cause, distributed robustness, is more poorly understood. It emerges from the distributed nature of many biological systems, where many (and different) parts contribute to system functions. I will here discuss evidence suggesting that distributed robustness is equally or more important for mutational robustness than gene redundancy. This evidence comes from the functional divergence of redundant genes, as well as from large-scale gene deletion studies. I also ask whether one can quantify the extent to which redundancy or distributed robustness contribute to mutational robustness.},

abstract = {Using a spatially explicit cellular automaton model with local competition, we investigate the potential for varied levels of competitive intransitivity (i.e., nonhierarchical competition) to promote species coexistence. As predicted, on average, increased levels of intransitivity result in more sustained coexistence within simulated communities, although the outcome of competition also becomes increasingly unpredictable. Interestingly, even a moderate degree of intransitivity within a community can promote coexistence, in terms of both the length of time until the first competitive exclusion and the number of species remaining in the community after 500 simulated generations. These results suggest that modest levels of intransitivity in nature, such as those that are thought to be characteristic of plant communities, can contribute to coexistence and, therefore, community-scale biodiversity. We explore a potential connection between competitive intransitivity and neutral theory, whereby competitive intransitivity may represent an important mechanism for "ecological equivalence."},

@book{Reza1961,
abstract = {Written for an engineering audience, this book has a threefold purpose: (1) to present elements of modern probability theory — discrete, continuous, and stochastic; (2) to present elements of information theory with emphasis on its basic roots in probability theory; and (3) to present elements of coding theory. The emphasis throughout the book is on such basic concepts as sets, the probability measure associated with sets, sample space, random variables, information measure, and capacity. These concepts proceed from set theory to probability theory and then to information and coding theories. No formal prerequisites are required other than the usual undergraduate mathematics included in an engineering or science program. However, since these programs may not include a course in probability, the author presents an introductory treatment of probability for those who wish to pursue the general study of statistical theory of communications. The book is divided into four parts: memoryless discrete themes, memoryless continuum, schemes with memory, and an outline of some recent developments. An appendix contains notes to help familiarize the reader with the literature in the field, while the inclusion of many reference tables and an extensive bibliography with some 200 entries makes this an excellent resource for any student in the field.},

Variance in isotope values for wolves and other carni-vores was investigated as a proxy for variation in diet among individuals. Isosource, an isotopic source parti-tioning model, quantified the relative range in propor-tions of five most-likely prey items in the diets of wolves. The distribution of feasible contributions from each source was dominated by elk (Cervus elaphus; mean: 48{\%}, range:11–75{\%}), followed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; mean: 21{\%}, range: 0–54{\%}), moose (Alces alces; mean:14{\%}, range: 0–41{\%}), beaver (Castor canadensis; mean: 8{\%}, range:0–25{\%}) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus; mean: 8{\%}, range: 0–24{\%}).

abstract = {The pressure to search effective bioremediation methodologies for contaminated ecosystems has led to the large-scale identification of microbial species and metabolic degradation pathways. However, minor attention has been paid to the study of bioremediation in marine food webs and to the definition of integrated strategies for reducing bioaccumulation in species. We propose a novel computational framework for analysing the multiscale effects of bioremediation at the ecosystem level, based on coupling food web bioaccumulation models and metabolic models of degrading bacteria. The combination of techniques from synthetic biology and ecological network analysis allows the specification of arbitrary scenarios of contaminant removal and the evaluation of strategies based on natural or synthetic microbial strains. In this study, we derive a bioaccumulation model of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Adriatic food web, and we extend a metabolic reconstruction of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (iJN746) with the aerobic pathway of PCBs degradation. We assess the effectiveness of different bioremediation scenarios in reducing PCBs concentration in species and we study indices of species centrality to measure their importance in the contaminant diffusion via feeding links. The analysis of the Adriatic sea case study suggests that our framework could represent a practical tool in the design of effective remediation strategies, providing at the same time insights into the ecological role of microbial communities within food webs.},

abstract = {Understanding functional relationships within ecological networks can help reveal keys to ecosystem stability or fragility. Revealing these relationships is complicated by the difficulties of isolating variables or performing experimental manipulations within a natural ecosystem, and thus inferences are often made by matching models to observational data. Such models, however, require assumptions-or detailed measurements-of parameters such as birth and death rate, encounter frequency, territorial exclusion, and predation success. Here, we evaluate the use of a Bayesian network inference algorithm, which can reveal ecological networks based upon species and habitat abundance alone. We test the algorithm's performance and applicability on observational data of avian communities and habitat in the Peak District National Park, United Kingdom. The resulting networks correctly reveal known relationships among habitat types and known interspecific relationships. In addition, the networks produced novel insights into ecosystem structure and identified key species with high connectivity. Thus, Bayesian networks show potential for becoming a valuable tool in ecosystem analysis.},

abstract = {Experimental data from intergenerational field manipulations of entire food webs are scarce, yet such approaches are essential for gauging impacts of environmental change in natural systems. We imposed 2 years of intermittent drought on stream channels in a replicated field trial, to measure food web responses to simulated climate change. Drought triggered widespread losses of species and links, with larger taxa and those that were rare for their size, many of which were predatory, being especially vulnerable. Many network properties, including size-scaling relationships within food chains, changed in response to drought. Other properties, such as connectance, were unaffected. These findings highlight the need for detailed experimental data from different organizational levels, from pairwise links to the entire food web. The loss of not only large species, but also those that were rare for their size, provides a newly refined way to gauge likely impacts that may be applied more generally to other systems and/or impacts.},

@article{Baird1980a,
abstract = {The fruit crops of a number of temperate forest plants that are eaten by birds ripen in the late summer or early fall and become available just before the main southbound migrations of many facultatively frugivorous birds. The fruit that remains at the end of the migratory period constitutes a major food resource for wintering bird populations. Few studies quantify differential use of fruit (Pulliam and Enders 1971). The research reported here was motivated by many questions. Are all types of fruit harvested simultaneously, or do some types disappear before others? What fraction of the original standing crop remains into the winter for harvest by resident populations? Do the food habits of resident species change as the relative abundances of different fruits vary through the winter? STUDY AREA AND METHODS In order to gain insight into the above questions, I studied the feeding habits of birds in a 600 ha tract of woods belonging to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, Mercer Co., New Jersey in the fall and winter of 1974-75. I found 23 species of fruit-bearing plants in the woods and along its margins. The species composition varied in different successional stages and with different moisture and soil conditions. To take into account the variety of stand types represented in the forest, I chose study sites in 3 different, relatively homogenous areas. The first study area comprised 235 m2 in an area grown in young red maple (Acrr rubrum) and white oak (Quercus alba) with American beech (Fagus gmndifolia) and some flowering dogwoods (Cornus florida); the diverse understory included mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium), false Solomon's seal (Smilacina racemosa), spicebush (Linrlera bensoin) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolin). In this plot, only the mapleleaf viburnum and false Solomon's seal produced fruit. The second plot was 470 m' of white oak, tuliptree (Liriodendron tuli{\~{}}x{\~{}}efera) and shagbark hickory (Carua ovata), with subcanopy of flowering dogwood, blackgum (/Vyssn sylvaticn) and American beech. Understory included mapleleaf viburnum, New York fern (Thrlypteris noveboracencis), greenbrier (Smilax rotunrlifolia), false Solomon's seal and spicebush. The dogwood and blackgum trees produced fruit, but most of the blackgum berries had already dropped when the study began. The viburnum, false Solomon's seal and spicebush had fruit. The third plot was 470 m2 of floodplain forest near the Stony Brook River. An open canopy of 2 large white oaks with box elders (Act-r negundo) beneath allowed much sunlight to pass through. Understory was mostly tall, woody spicebush and vine poison ivy (Rhus m{\&}cans) densely entwined the trunks of the oaks. Both the spicebush and poison ivy produced large crops of berries. All fruit on each plant in the 3 plots was counted at the outset of the study, as were the berries on 8 spicebushes in different parts of the floodplain study area (Table 1). Fruits (usually 30/species) were dried in an oven to constant weight, and then seeds were removed to give dry weight. 63},

abstract = {Camptothecin derivatives are clinically used antitumor alkaloids that belong to monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. In this study, we investigated the biosynthetic pathway of camptothecin from [1-13C]glucose (Glc) by in silico and in vivo studies. The in silico study measured the incorporation of Glc into alkaloids using the Atomic Reconstruction of Metabolism software and predicted the labeling patterns of successive metabolites from [1-13C]Glc. The in vivo study followed incorporation of [1-13C]Glc into camptothecin with hairy roots of Ophiorrhiza pumila by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 13C-labeling pattern of camptothecin isolated from the hairy roots clearly showed that the monoterpene-secologanin moiety was synthesized via the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway, not via the mevalonate pathway. This conclusion was supported by differential inhibition of camptothecin accumulation by the pathway-specific inhibitors (fosmidomycin and lovastatin). The quinoline moiety from tryptophan was also labeled as predicted by the Atomic Reconstruction of Metabolism program via the shikimate pathway. These results indicate that camptothecin is formed by the combination of the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway and the shikimate pathway. This study provides the innovative example for how a computer-aided comprehensive metabolic analysis will refine the experimental design to obtain more precise biological information.},

abstract = {A new structure-activity relationship model predicting the probability for a compound to inhibit human cytochrome P450 3A4 has been developed using data for {\textgreater}800 compounds from various literature sources and tested on PubChem screening data. Novel GALAS (Global, Adjusted Locally According to Similarity) modeling methodology has been used, which is a combination of baseline global QSAR model and local similarity based corrections. GALAS modeling method allows forecasting the reliability of prediction thus defining the model applicability domain. For compounds within this domain the statistical results of the final model approach the data consistency between experimental data from literature and PubChem datasets with the overall accuracy of 89{\%}. However, the original model is applicable only for less than a half of PubChem database. Since the similarity correction procedure of GALAS modeling method allows straightforward model training, the possibility to expand the applicability domain has been investigated. Experimental data from PubChem dataset served as an example of in-house high-throughput screening data. The model successfully adapted itself to both data classified using the same and different IC₅₀ threshold compared with the training set. In addition, adjustment of the CYP3A4 inhibition model to compounds with a novel chemical scaffold has been demonstrated. The reported GALAS model is proposed as a useful tool for virtual screening of compounds for possible drug-drug interactions even prior to the actual synthesis.},

abstract = {Accurate identification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is the key step in understanding proteins' biological functions, which are typically context-dependent. Many existing PPI predictors rely on aggregated features from protein sequences, however only a few methods exploit local information about specific residue contacts. In this work we present a two-stage machine learning approach for prediction of protein-protein interactions. We start with the carefully filtered data on protein complexes available for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. First, we build linear descriptions of interacting and non-interacting sequence segment pairs based on their inter-residue distances. Secondly, we train machine learning classifiers to predict binary segment interactions for any two short sequence fragments. The final prediction of the protein-protein interaction is done using the 2D matrix representation of all-against-all possible interacting sequence segments of both analysed proteins. The level-I predictor achieves 0.88 AUC for micro-scale, i.e., residue-level prediction. The level-II predictor improves the results further by a more complex learning paradigm. We perform 30-fold macro-scale, i.e., protein-level cross-validation experiment. The level-II predictor using PSIPRED-predicted secondary structure reaches 0.70 precision, 0.68 recall, and 0.70 AUC, whereas other popular methods provide results below 0.6 threshold (recall, precision, AUC). Our results demonstrate that multi-scale sequence features aggregation procedure is able to improve the machine learning results by more than 10{\%} as compared to other sequence representations.

The abnormal porphyrins, identified by NMR and other spectroscopic methods, are N-alkylated protoporphyrin IX derivatives in which the N-alkyl moiety is derived from the parent drug by addition of a hydroxyl group to the internal carbon and of a porphyrin nitrogen to the terminal carbon of the pi-bond. A secondary reaction of the hydroxyl with the amide group converts the N-alkyl moiety into a lactone. The indicated alkylation-lactonization sequence is supported by the fact that the AIA adduct formed under an atmosphere of 18O2 incorporates one labeled oxygen atom.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) methods often rely on docking score. The docking score is an over-simplification of the actual ligand-target binding. Its capability to model and predict the actual binding reality is limited. Recently, interaction fingerprinting (IFP) has come and offered us an alternative way to model reality. IFP provides us an alternate way to examine protein-ligand interactions. The docking score indicates the approximate affinity and IFP shows the interaction specificity. IFP is a method to convert three dimensional (3D) protein-ligand interactions into one dimensional (1D) bitstrings. The bitstrings are subsequently employed to compare the protein-ligand interaction predicted by the docking tool against the reference ligand. These comparisons produce scores that can be used to enhance the quality of SBVS campaigns. However, some IFP tools are either proprietary or using a proprietary library, which limits the access to the tools and the development of customized IFP algorithm. Therefore, we have developed PyPLIF, a Python-based open source tool to analyze IFP. In this article, we describe PyPLIF and its application to enhance the quality of SBVS in order to identify antagonists for estrogen $\alpha$ receptor (ER$\alpha$).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: PyPLIF is freely available at http://code.google.com/p/pyplif.},

abstract = {Flavocytochrome P-450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium is a 119 kDa polypeptide whose heme and diflavin domains are fused to produce a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid monooxygenase. Redox potentiometry studies have been performed with intact flavocytochrome P-450 BM3 and with its component heme, diflavin, FAD, and FMN domains. Results indicate that electron flow occurs from the NADPH donor through FAD, then FMN and on to the heme center where fatty acid substrate is bound and monooxygenation occurs. Prevention of futile cycling of electrons is avoided through an increase in redox potential of more than 100 mV caused by binding of fatty acids to the active site of P-450. Redox potentials are little altered for the component domains with respect to their values in the larger constructs, providing further evidence for the discrete domain organization of this flavocytochrome. The reduction potentials of the 4-electron reduced diflavin domain and 2-electron reduced FAD domain are considerably lower than those for the blue FAD semiquinone species observed during reductive titrations of these enzymes and that of the physiological electron donor (NADPH), indicating that the FAD hydroquinone is thermodynamically unfavorable and does not accumulate under turnover conditions. In contrast, the FMN hydroquinone is thermodynamically more favorable than the semiquinone.},

In addition, the prospects for research in this field are considered, and advances are predicted in four broad areas: improved basic knowledge of enzyme catalysis and regulation; synthesis of fine chemicals, including drug design and screening; removal of undesirable environmental chemicals; and biomedical applications related to steroid, drug, carcinogen, and alcohol metabolism.},

At the same time, a small number of well-studied lncRNAs have given us important clues about the biology of these molecules, and a few key functional and mechanistic themes have begun to emerge, although the robustness of these models and classification schemes remains to be seen. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the lncRNA field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological functions, and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs.

Bacterial genomes also carry surprises, such as the 20 P450s found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the 7 in Bacillus subtilis. The race to finish the human genome has already identified the majority of human P450s, some by expressed sequence tags only. The rapid discovery of new genes is being complemented by detailed analysis of our human genes to identify and characterize the complete set of human P450 polymorphisms and disease-causing mutations, one aspect of our "chemical individuality." Phylogenetic trees are included for plant, fungal, animal, and bacterial P450s. Emphasis is given to the higher order nomenclature of P450 clans, as a tool to see the larger picture of P450 evolution. Arabidopsis is the current record holder in P450 genes, with 186 named genes and a prediction of 350 in the total genome to be completed next year.

abstract = {Microsomal P450-mediated monooxygenase activity supported by NADPH requires an interaction between flavoprotein NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome P450. These proteins have been identified as the simplest system (with the inclusion of a phospholipid (PL) component) that possesses monooxygenase function; however, little is known about the organization of these proteins in the microsomal membrane. Although reductase and P450 are known to form a 1:1 functional complex, there exists a 10- to 20-fold excess of P450 over the reductase. This raises several questions including "How are the enzymes of the P450 system organized in the microsomal membrane?" and "Can one P450 enzyme affect the functional characteristics of another P450?" This review summarizes evidence supporting the potential for enzymes involved in the P450 system to interact, focusing on the interactions between reductase and P450 and interactions between multiple P450 enzymes. Studies on the aggregation characteristics of P450 as well as on rotational diffusion are detailed, with a special emphasis on the potential for P450 enzymes to produce oligomeric complexes and to suggest the environment in which P450 exists in the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, more recent studies describing the potential for multiple P450s to exist as complexes and their effect on P450 function are presented, including studies using reconstituted systems as well as systems where two P450s are coexpressed in the presence of reductase. An understanding of the interactions among reductase and multiple P450s is important for predicting conditions where the drug disposition may be altered by the direct effects of P450-P450 complex formation. Furthermore, the potential for one P450 enzyme to affect the behavior of another P450 may be extremely important for drug screening and development, requiring metabolic screening of a drug with reconstituted systems containing multiple P450s rather than simpler systems containing only a single form. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inherited differences in the metabolism and disposition of drugs, and genetic polymorphisms in the targets of drug therapy (e.g., receptors), can greatly influence efficacy and toxicity of medications. Marked interethnic differences in CYP2C19 (a member of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme superfamily catalyzing phase I drug metabolism) which affects the metabolism of a number of clinically important drugs have been documented. The present study evaluated the activity of CYP2C19 in normal, healthy Gujrati and Marwadi subjects by phenotyping (a western Indian population). METHODS: All subjects received 20 mg of omeprazole, which was followed by blood collection at 3 hrs to estimate the metabolic ratio of omeprazole to 5-hydroxyomeprazole. The analysis was done by HPLC. RESULTS: It was seen that 10.36{\%} of this population were poor metabolizers(PM) whereas 89.63{\%} were extensive metabolizers(EM). CONCLUSION: A genotyping evaluation would better help in identifying population specific genotypes and thus help individualize drug therapy.},

@article{Estabrook2003,
abstract = {Many members of the superfamily of hemeproteins, known as cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP), are currently described in the literature (over 2000 at the date of this writing) [see Nelson, 2003 (http://drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html)]. In mammalian tissues, the P450s play central roles in drug and xenobiotic metabolism as well as steroid hormone synthesis, fat-soluble vitamin metabolism, and the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to biologically active molecules. P450s also play a major role in plants by catalyzing the synthesis of a large number of secondary metabolites. Today we appreciate the unique oxygen chemistry catalyzed by the P450 enzymes as well as the dramatic effect of protein structural changes resulting in modifications of substrate specificity. Recent scientific advances have shown the importance of genetic differences (polymorphisms) in altering the physiological response of an animal to endo- and exo-biotic chemicals. In many instances these changes can be directly attributed to small differences in the amino acid sequence of a P450. The present article describes some of the early events associated with the establishment of the biological function of P450s. The 1950s and 1960s showed the transition of P450 from an unknown spectroscopic curiosity to the major player it now occupies in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The P450s are now recognized to occupy a great variety of phylogenetically distributed isoform activities. Much has been learned about the P450s, but much more remains as poorly understood. It has been almost 50 years since this class of unique proteins were discovered and their catalytic functions characterized. The present article describes the background and early history of research leading to our present knowledge of the cytochromes P450. Hopefully we will learn lessons from this history as we venture forward down the path of future scientific discovery.},

Today, our basic understanding of many of the human P450s is relatively well-established, in terms of the details of the individual genes, sequences, and basic catalytic mechanisms. Crystal structures of several of the major human P450s are now in hand. The animal P450s are still important in the context of metabolism and safety testing. Many well-defined examples exist for roles of P450s in decreasing the adverse effects of drugs through biotransformation, and an equally interesting field of investigation is the bioactivation of chemicals, including drugs. Unresolved problems include the characterization of the minor "orphan" P450s, ligand cooperativity and kinetic complexity of several P450s, the prediction of metabolism, the overall contribution of bioactivation to drug idiosyncratic problems, the extrapolation of animal test results to humans in drug development, and the contribution of genetic variation in human P450s to cancer incidence.},

abstract = {Networks provide a natural representation of molecular biology knowledge, in particular to model relationships between biological entities such as genes, proteins, drugs, or diseases. Because of the effort, the cost, or the lack of the experiments necessary for the elucidation of these networks, computational approaches for network inference have been frequently investigated in the literature. In this paper, we examine the assessment of supervised network inference. Supervised inference is based on machine learning techniques that infer the network from a training sample of known interacting and possibly non-interacting entities and additional measurement data. While these methods are very effective, their reliable validation in silico poses a challenge, since both prediction and validation need to be performed on the basis of the same partially known network. Cross-validation techniques need to be specifically adapted to classification problems on pairs of objects. We perform a critical review and assessment of protocols and measures proposed in the literature and derive specific guidelines how to best exploit and evaluate machine learning techniques for network inference. Through theoretical considerations and in silico experiments, we analyze in depth how important factors influence the outcome of performance estimation. These factors include the amount of information available for the interacting entities, the sparsity and topology of biological networks, and the lack of experimentally verified non-interacting pairs.},

abstract = {The evolutionary pressures that shaped the specificity and catalytic efficiency of enzymes can only be speculated. While directed evolution experiments show that new functions can be acquired under positive selection with few mutations, the role of negative selection in eliminating undesired activities and achieving high specificity remains unclear. Here we examine intermediates along the 'lineage' from a naturally occurring C12-C20 fatty acid hydroxylase (P450BM3) to a laboratory-evolved P450 propane monooxygenase (P450PMO) having 20 heme domain substitutions compared to P450BM3. Biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses show that a minimal perturbation of the P450BM3 fold and substrate-binding pocket accompanies a significant broadening of enzyme substrate range and the emergence of propane activity. In contrast, refinement of the enzyme catalytic efficiency for propane oxidation (??? 9000-fold increase in kcat/Km) involves profound reshaping and partitioning of the substrate access pathway. Remodeling of the substrate-recognition mechanisms ultimately results in remarkable narrowing of the substrate profile around propane and enables the acquisition of a basal iodomethane dehalogenase activity as yet unknown in natural alkane monooxygenases. A highly destabilizing L188P substitution in a region of the enzyme that undergoes a large conformational change during catalysis plays an important role in adaptation to the gaseous alkane. This work demonstrates that positive selection alone is sufficient to completely respecialize the cytochrome P450 for function on a nonnative substrate.},

There is also a broad versatility of reactions catalysed by cytochromes P450 such as carbon hydroxylation, heteroatom oxygenation, dealkylation, epoxidation, aromatic hydroxylation, reduction, dehalogenation (Sono, M., Roach, M.P., Coulter, E.D., Dawson, J.H., 1996. Heme-containing oxygenases. Chem. Rev. 96, 2841-2888), (Werck-Reichhart, D., Feyereisen, R., 2000. Cytochromes P450: a success story. Genome Biol. 1 (REVIEWS3003)), (Bernhardt, R., 2004. Cytochrome P-450. Encyclopedia Biol. Chem. 1, 544-549), (Bernhardt, R., 2004. Optimized chimeragenesis; creating diverse P450 functions. Chem. Biol. 11, 287-288), (Guengerich, F.P., 2004. Cytochrome P450: what have we learned and what are the future issues? Drug Metab. Rev. 36, 159-197). More than 5000 different P450 genes have been cloned up to date (for details see: http://drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html). Members of the same gene family are defined as usually having ???40{\%} sequence identity to a P450 protein from any other family. Mammalian sequences within the same subfamily are always {\textgreater}55{\%} identical. The numbers of individual P450 enzymes in different species differ significantly, showing the highest numbers observed so far in plants. The structure-function relationships of cytochromes P450 are far from being well understood and their catalytic power has so far hardly been used for biotechnological processes. Nevertheless, the set of interesting reactions being catalysed by these systems and the availability of new genetic engineering techniques allowing to heterologously express them and to improve and change their activity, stability and selectivity as well as the increasing interest of the industry in life sciences makes them promising candidates for biotechnological application in the future. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family is involved in the biotransformation of many xenobiotics. As part of the U.S. Tox21 Phase I effort, we profiled the CYP activity of approximately three thousand compounds, primarily those of environmental concern, against human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 isoforms in a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) format. In order to evaluate the extent to which computational models built from a drug-like library screened in these five CYP assays under the same conditions can accurately predict the outcome of an environmental compound library, five support vector machines (SVM) models built from over 17,000 drug-like compounds were challenged to predict the CYP activities of the Tox21 compound collection. Although a large fraction of the test compounds fall outside of the applicability domain (AD) of the models, as measured by k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) similarities, the predictions were largely accurate for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 ioszymes with area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC-ROC) ranging between 0.82 and 0.84. The lower predictive power of the CYP2C19 model (AUC-ROC = 0.76) is caused by experimental errors and that of the CYP2D6 model (AUC-ROC = 0.76) can be rescued by rebalancing the training data. Our results demonstrate that decomposing molecules into atom types enhanced the coverage of the AD and that computational models built from drug-like molecules can be used to predict the ability of non-drug like compounds to interact with these CYPs.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described. Curr. Protoc.

abstract = {Rational approaches have been extensively used to investigate the role of active site residues in cytochrome P450 (CYP) functions. However, recent studies using random mutagenesis suggest an important role for non-active site residues in CYP functions. Meta-analysis of the random mutants showed that 75{\%} of the functionally important non-active site residues are present in 20{\%} of the entire protein between helices E and H (E-H) and conserved sequence motif (CSM) between 7 and 11. The CSM approach was developed recently to investigate the functional role of non-active site residues in CYP2B4. Furthermore, we identified and analyzed the CSM in multiple CYP families and subfamilies in the E-H region. Results from CSM analysis showed that CSM 7, 8, 10, and 11 are conserved in CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 families, while CSM 9 is conserved only in CYP2 family. Analysis of different CYP2 subfamilies showed that CYP2B and CYP2C have similar characteristics in the CSM, while the characteristics of CYP2A and CYP2D subfamilies are different. Finally, we analyzed CSM 7, 8, 10, and 11, which are common in all the CYP families/subfamilies analyzed, in fifteen important drug-metabolizing CYPs. The results showed that while CSM 8 is most conserved among these CYPs, CSM 7, 9, and 10 have significant variations. We suggest that CSM8 has a common role in all the CYPs that have been analyzed, while CSM 7, 10, and 11 may have relatively specific role within the subfamily. We further suggest that these CSM play important role in opening and closing of the substrate access/egress channel by modulating the flexible/plastic region of the protein. Thus, site-directed mutagenesis of these CSM can be used to study structure-function and dynamic/plasticity-function relationships and to design CYP biocatalysts.},

abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

abstract = {A two-state rebound mechanism of alkane hydroxylation by a model active species of the enzyme cytochrome P450 is studied using density functional theoretic calculations. Theory corroborates Groves's rebound mechanism (Groves, J. T. J. Chem. Educ. 1985, 62, 928), with a key difference,namely that in the two-state rebound the reactivity and product distribution result from the interplay of two reactive states of the active ferryl-oxene (Por(+.)FeO) species of the enzyme: one state is low-spin (doublet) and the other high-spin (quartet). Transition-state structures, intermediates, and product complexes are identified for the two states. The bond activation in either one of the two states involves a hydrogen abstraction-like transition structure. However, while in the high-spin state there forms a radical that has a significant barrier for rebound, in the low-spin state the rebound is virtually barrierless. Even though one cannot ignore incursion of a small amount of radicals in the low-spin state, it is clear that the radical has a significant lifetime mainly on the high-spin surface. The results are used to gain insight into puzzling experimental data which emerge from studies of ultrafast radical clocks (e.g., Toy, P. H.; Newcomb, M.; Hollenberg, P. F., J. Am. Chem. Sec. 1998, 120, 7719), vis a vis the nature the transition state, deduced from kinetic isotope effect measurements (Manchester, J. I.; Dinnocenzo, J. P.; Higgins, L. A.; Jones, J. P. J. Am. Chem. Sec. 1997, 119, 5069) and stereochemical scrambling patterns (Groves, J. T.; McClusky, G. A.; White, R. E.; Goon, M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978, 81, 154). Understanding the electronic structure of the various species leads to a predictive structure-reactivity picture, based on the two-state reactivity scenario (Shaik, S.; Filatov, M.; Schroder, D.; Schwarz, H. Chem. fur. J. 1998, 4, 193). The model makes it possible to predict the dependence of the relative rates of the two states, and of the corresponding steps as a function of the nature of the alkane, the resulting alkyl radical, and the binding capability of the thiolate proximal ligand of the active species.},

The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved.

abstract = {Cytochromes P450 (CYP for isoforms) play a central role in biological processes especially metabolism of chiral molecules; thus, development of computational methods to predict parameters for chiral reactions is important for advancing this field. In this study, we identified the most optimal artificial neural networks using conformation-independent chirality codes to predict CYP2C19 catalytic parameters for enantioselective reactions. Optimization of the neural networks required identifying the most suitable representation of structure among a diverse array of training substrates, normalizing distribution of the corresponding catalytic parameters (k cat, Km, and kcat/Km), and determining the best topology for networks to make predictions. Among different structural descriptors, the use of partial atomic charges according to the CHelpG scheme and inclusion of hydrogens yielded the most optimal artificial neural networks. Their training also required resolution of poorly distributed output catalytic parameters using a Box-Cox transformation. End point leave-one-out cross correlations of the best neural networks revealed that predictions for individual catalytic parameters (kcat and K m) were more consistent with experimental values than those for catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Lastly, neural networks predicted correctly enantioselectivity and comparable catalytic parameters measured in this study for previously uncharacterized CYP2C19 substrates, R- and S-propranolol. Taken together, these seminal computational studies for CYP2C19 are the first to predict all catalytic parameters for enantioselective reactions using artificial neural networks and thus provide a foundation for expanding the prediction of cytochrome P450 reactions to chiral drugs, pollutants, and other biologically active compounds. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) arise from the indole and the monoterpene pathways. The latter route derives from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). We report on the isolation and characterization of a cDNA (crdxs) encoding for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) in Catharanthus roseus suspension cultures. The enzyme catalyses the formation of the precursor of the non-mevalonate pathway leading to IPP biosynthesis. Expression in Escherichia coli of the truncated DXPS lacking the putative plastid transit peptide revealed that this pseudomature protein was active, crdxs mRNA were detected only in TIA producing-cells and the accumulation of transcripts was found to be associated with TIA production. This result corroborates recent studies obtained with a labelled precursor, which have given evidence that the non-mevalonate pathway is involved in the biosynthesis of the precursor of TIAs secologanin.

abstract = {The human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily plays an important role in drug-drug interactions, drug metabolism, and toxicity. Therefore, prediction of CYP450 inhibitors is extremely important in drug discovery and personal medicine. In this paper, characterized by fragment-based molecular hologram and MACCS descriptors, over 12,000 unique compounds with known CYP2C19 inhibitory activities were used to develop prediction models by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. By combining two types of fragment-based descriptors, an optimal SVM model with an RBF kernel was obtained. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were 86.54{\%}, 83.39{\%}, 84.76{\%}, and 0.6946 for a training set (. n=. 5,387), and 83.19{\%}, 78.82{\%}, 80.72{\%}, and 0.6152 for a test set (. n=. 5,383), respectively. The optimal SVM model was further validated by an independent dataset (. n=. 1,470) with an overall accuracy of 82.38{\%}. The results showed that these two types of fragment-based descriptors are, in some degree, complementary to each other, and can be combined to enhance model predictive power. In comparison with other 2-D or 3-D description methods, the combination of fragment descriptors seems extremely useful in constructing high-throughput screening models of CYP inhibitors in the process of drug discovery. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To examine the roles of the proximal thiolate iron ligand, the C357H mutant of P450(cam) (CYP101) was characterized by resonance Raman, UV, circular dichroism, and activity measurements. The C357H mutant must be reconstituted with hemin for activity to be observed. The reconstituted enzyme is a mixture of high and low spin species. Low temperature (10 degrees C), low enzyme concentration (1 microM), high camphor concentration (1 mM), and 5--50 mM buffer concentrations increase the high to low spin ratio, but under no conditions examined was the protein more than 60{\%} high spin. The C357H mutant has a poorer K(m) for camphor (23 vs 2 microM) and a poorer K(d) for putidaredoxin (50 vs 20 microM) than wild-type P450(cam). The mutant also exhibits a greatly decreased camphor oxidation rate, elevated uncoupling rate, and much greater peroxidase activity. Electron transfer from putidaredoxin to the mutant is much slower than to the wild-type even though redox potential measurements show that the electron transfer remains thermodynamically favored. These experiments confirm that the thiolate ligand facilitates the O--O bond cleavage by P450 enzymes and also demonstrate that this ligand satisfies important roles in protein folding, substrate binding, and electron transfer.},

abstract = {The second edition of this book widens the scope of the methods and applications of Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis. We have introduced more up to date data sets in our examples. These give the text a higher degree of timeliness and add an even more applied flavour. Since multivariate statistical methods are heavily used in quantitative finance and risk management we have put more weight on the presentation of distributions and their densities. We discuss in detail different families of heavy tailed distributions (Laplace, Generalized Hy- perbolic). We also devoted a section on copulae, a new concept of dependency used in the financial risk management and credit scoring. In the chapter on computer intensive meth- ods we have added support vector machines, a new classification technique from statistical learning theory. We apply this method to bankruptcy and rating analysis of firms. The very important CART (Classification and Regression Tree) technique is also now inserted into this chapter. We give an application to rating of companies. The probably most important step towards readability and user friendliness of this book is that we have translated all Quantlets into the R and Matlab language. The algorithms can be downloaded from the authors' web sites. In the preparation of this 2nd edition, we received helpful output from Anton Andriyashin, Ying Chen, Song Song and Uwe Ziegenhagen.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD Cytochrome P450 enzymes comprise a superfamily of heme monooxygenases that are of considerable interest for the: i) synthesis of novel drugs and drug metabolites; ii) targeted cancer gene therapy; iii) biosensor design; and iv) bioremediation. However, their applications are limited because cytochrome P450, especially mammalian P450 enzymes, show a low turnover rate and stability, and require a complex source of electrons through cytochrome P450 reductase and NADPH. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW In this review, we discuss the recent progress towards the use of P450 enzymes in a variety of the above-mentioned applications. We also present alternate and cost-effective ways to perform P450-mediated reaction, especially using peroxides. Furthermore, we expand upon the current progress in P450 engineering approaches describing several recent examples that are utilized to enhance heterologous expression, stability, catalytic efficiency and utilization of alternate oxidants. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The review provides a comprehensive knowledge in the design of P450 biocatalysts for potentially practical purposes. Finally, we provide a prospective on the future aspects of P450 engineering and its applications in biotechnology, medicine and bioremediation. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Because of its wide applications, academic and pharmaceutical researchers, environmental scientists and healthcare providers are expected to gain current knowledge and future prospects of the practical use of P450 biocatalysts.},

abstract = {Cytochromes P450 are members of a superfamily of hemoproteins involved in the oxidative metabolism of various physiologic and xenobiotic compounds in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Studies on bacterial P450s, particularly those involved in monoterpene oxidation, have provided an integral contribution to our understanding of these proteins, away from the problems encountered with eukaryotic forms. We report here a novel cytochrome P450 (P450(cin), CYP176A1) purified from a strain of Citrobacter braakii that is capable of using cineole 1 as its sole source of carbon and energy. This enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and the amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides determined. By using this information, a PCR-based cloning strategy was developed that allowed the isolation of a 4-kb DNA fragment containing the cytochrome P450(cin) gene (cinA). Sequencing revealed three open reading frames that were identified on the basis of sequence homology as a cytochrome P450, an NADPH-dependent flavodoxin/ferrodoxin reductase, and a flavodoxin. This arrangement suggests that P450(cin) may be the first isolated P450 to use a flavodoxin as its natural redox partner. Sequencing also identified the unprecedented substitution of a highly conserved, catalytically important active site threonine with an asparagine residue. The P450 gene was subcloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli at approximately 2000 nmol/liter of original culture, and purification was achieved by standard protocols. Postulating the native E. coli flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase system might mimic the natural redox partners of P450(cin), it was expressed in E. coli in the presence of cineole 1. A product was formed in vivo that was tentatively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxycineole 2. Examination of P450(cin) by UV-visible spectroscopy revealed typical spectra characteristic of P450s, a high affinity for cineole 1 (K(D) = 0.7 microm), and a large spin state change of the heme iron associated with binding of cineole 1. These facts support the hypothesis that cineole 1 is the natural substrate for this enzyme and that P450(cin) catalyzes the initial monooxygenation of cineole 1 biodegradation. This constitutes the first characterization of an enzyme involved in this pathway.},

Cross-training with support vector machine, multilabel k-nearest-neighbor and counterpropagation neural network modeling methods were used in the multilabel approach, which allows one to classify the compounds simultaneously in multiple classes. In the single-label models, automatic variable selection was combined with various cross-validation experiments and modeling techniques. Moreover, the reliability of both multi- and single-label models was assessed by the prediction of an external test set. Finally, the predicted results of the best models were compared to show that, even if the models present similar performances, the multilabel approach more coherently reflects the real metabolism information.},

The content of flavine is 45 that of cytochrome b5. The flavine probably does not contribute to the DPNH reduced difference spectrum. The difference spectra of the reduced minus oxidized pigments have been determined. Reduction with DPNH yields only the difference spectrum of cytochrome b5; reduction with dithionite changes this spectrum further, probably due to the reduction of small amounts of methemoglobin. Carbon monoxide forms an intense absorption band at 450 m$\mu$ upon reduction of the microsomes by DPNH or dithionite, but no corresponding absorption band in the visible region has been found. The CO 450-m$\mu$ absorption appears only to a small extent in preparations containing 2{\%} cholate. The molecular extinction coefficient of cytochrome b5 has been determined by titrations with DPNH and ferricyanide to be 160 cm.−1 mM−1 for the Soret peak and 20 cm.−1 mM−1 for the $\alpha$-peak (peak-to-trough values in the difference spectrum).},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450 27A1 (P450 27A1) is an important metabolic enzyme involved in bile acid biosynthesis and the activation of vitamin D3 in mammals. Recombinant P450 27A1 heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli was found to be copurified with phospholipids (PLs). The PL content varied in different preparations and was dependent on the purification protocol. A link between the increased amounts of PLs and deterioration of the enzyme substrate binding properties was also observed. Tandem negative ionization mass spectrometry identified phosphatidylglycerol (PG) as the major PL copurified with P450 27A1. Subsequent reconstitution of P450 into exogenous PG vesicles assessed the effect of this contamination on substrate binding and enzyme activity. Two other PLs, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS), were also tested. PG and PE increased the Kd for 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol and cholesterol binding, whereas PS had no effect on either substrate binding. PG and PE did not significantly alter 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol hydroxylase activity and even stimulated cholesterol hydroxylase activity. PS inhibited 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol hydrolyase activity and had no effect on cholesterol hydroxylase activity. Our study shows the potential for PLs to regulate the activity of P450 27A1 in vivo and alter the amount of cholesterol degraded through the "classical" and "alternative" bile acid biosynthetic pathways.},

abstract = {The present article reviews the history of research on the hydroxylation of steroid hormones as catalyzed by enzymes present in mammalian tissues. The report describes how studies of steroid hormone synthesis have played a central role in the discovery of the monooxygenase functions of the cytochrome P450s. Studies of steroid hydroxylation reactions can be credited with showing that: (a) the adrenal mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the 11??-hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone was the first mammalian enzyme shown by O18 studies to be an oxygenase; (b) the adrenal microsomal enzyme catalyzing the 21-hydroxylation of steroids was the first mammalian enzyme to show experimentally the proposed 1:1:1 stoichiometry (substrate:oxygen:reduced pyridine nucleotide) of a monooxygenase reaction; (c) application of the photochemical action spectrum technique for reversal of carbon monoxide inhibition of the 21-hydroxylation of 17??-OH progesterone was the first demonstration that cytochrome P450 was an oxygenase; (d) spectrophotometric studies of the binding of 17??-OH progesterone to bovine adrenal microsomal P450 revealed the first step in the cyclic reaction scheme of P450, as it catalyzes the "activation" of oxygen in a monooxygenase reaction; (e) purified adrenodoxin was shown to function as an electron transport component of the adrenal mitochondrial monooxygenase system required for the activity of the 11??-hydroxylase reaction. Adrenodoxin was the first iron-sulfur protein isolated and purified from mammalian tissues and the first soluble protein identified as a reductase of a P450; (f) fractionation of adrenal mitochondrial P450 and incubation with adrenodoxin and a cytosolic (flavoprotein) fraction were the first demonstration of the reconstitution of a mammalian P450 monooxygenase reaction. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Enzymes are the proteins that accelerate the rate of chemical reaction, and both their structures and dynamics may be important to their function of catalyzing biochemical reactions. For the function prediction and classification of enzymes, many methods based on sequence similarity to detect similar proteins have been developed. However, these methods often miscarry in the case of the absence of similar sequences or poor similarity among proteins. Therefore, many researchers have been developing alternative approaches that assign function from protein features without consideration of sequence similarity. In this paper, we propose a method of sequence-driven feature extraction and enzyme functional classification using only the features of protein sequence, excluding predicted secondary structures and annotation information of protein databases. Our experimental results demonstrate that the enzyme classification based on the Chi-Squared ranking method among various attribute selection methods is efficient. Also, we And that amino acid composition of specific enzyme differs from composition of other enzymes.},

MuteinDB is broadly applicable to any known protein and their variants and makes mutagenesis and biochemical data searchable and comparable in a simple and easy-to-use manner. For the import of new mutein data, a simple, standardized, spreadsheet-based data format has been defined.

abstract = {The active site of cytochromes P450 is situated deep inside the protein next to the heme cofactor. Consequently, enzyme specificity and kinetics can be influenced by how substrates pass through the protein to access the active site and how products egress from the active site. We previously analysed the channels between the active site and the protein surface in P450 crystal structures available in October 2003 [R.C. Wade, P.J. Winn, I. Schlichting, Sudarko, A survey of active site access channels in cytochromes P450, J. Inorg. Biochem. 98 (2004) 1175-1182]. Since then, 52 new P450 structures have been made available, including entries for ten isozymes for which structures were not previously available. We present an updated survey covering all P450 crystal structures available in March 2006. This survey shows channels not observed earlier in crystal structures, some of which were identified in previous molecular dynamics simulations. The crystal structures demonstrate how some of the channels can merge when the protein structure opens up resulting in a wide cleft to the active site, caused largely by movements of the F-G helix-loop-helix and the B-C loop. Significant differences were observed between the channels in the crystal structures of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes. The multiplicity of channels suggests possibilities for substrate channelling to and from the P450s.},

abstract = {Adverse side effects of drug-drug interactions induced by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition is an important consideration, especially, during the research phase of drug discovery. It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitive effect of a compound against a specific CYP isoform. In this study, inhibitor predicting models were developed for five major CYP isoforms, namely 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, using a combined classifier algorithm on a large data set containing more than 24,700 unique compounds, extracted from PubChem. The combined classifiers algorithm is an ensemble of different independent machine learning classifiers including support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, fused by a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). All developed models were validated by 5-fold cross-validation and a diverse validation set composed of about 9000 diverse unique compounds. The range of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation sets was 0.764 to 0.815 for CYP1A2, 0.837 to 0.861 for CYP2C9, 0.793 to 0.842 for CYP2C19, 0.839 to 0.886 for CYP2D6, and 0.754 to 0.790 for CYP3A4, respectively, using the new developed combined classifiers. The overall performance of the combined classifiers fused by BP-ANN was superior to that of three classic fusion techniques (Mean, Maximum, and Multiply). The chemical spaces of data sets were explored by multidimensional scaling plots, and the use of applicability domain improved the prediction accuracies of models. In addition, some representative substructure fragments differentiating CYP inhibitors and noninhibitors were characterized by the substructure fragment analysis. These classification models are applicable for virtual screening of the five major CYP isoforms inhibitors or can be used as simple filters of potential chemicals in drug discovery.},

This system has thus provided a means for studying the extensive collection of membrane bound cytochromes P450 with the same biochemical and biophysical tools that have been previously limited to use with the soluble P450s.

Significant improvements in homogeneity and stability of these preparations open new possibilities for detailed analysis of equilibrium and steady-state kinetic characteristics of catalytic mechanisms of human cytochromes P450 involved in xenobiotic metabolism and in steroid biosynthesis.

abstract = {Enzyme sequences and structures are routinely used in the biological sciences as queries to search for functionally related enzymes in online databases. To this end, one usually departs from some notion of similarity, comparing two enzymes by looking for correspondences in their sequences, structures or surfaces. For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the enzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while information about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is ignored. In this work, we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved by applying kernel-based learning algorithms. This approach enables the detection of statistical dependencies between similarities of the active cleft and the biological function of annotated enzymes. This is in contrast to search-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into account. Similarity measures based on the active cleft are known to outperform sequence-based or structure-based measures under certain conditions. We consider the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification hierarchy for obtaining annotated enzymes during the training phase. The results of a set of sizeable experiments indicate a consistent and significant improvement for a set of similarity measures that exploit information about small cavities in the surface of enzymes.},

The stereochemistry of trans-1-[1-2H]octene is retained during both transformations. This alkylation stereochemistry requires addition of the pyrrole nitrogen and the activated oxygen to the same side of the double bond, a reaction geometry opposite to that expected if the heme were alkylated by the epoxide metabolite. Stereochemical analysis shows that the S enantiomer of the epoxide is formed in slight excess over the R enantiomer by oxidation of the re and si faces, respectively, of the olefin, but that heme alkylation only occurs during oxidation of the re face. The stereochemical specificity of epoxidation and heme alkylation requires that (a) the two processes proceed by independent (probably concerted) mechanisms, or (b) the two processes diverge from a common acyclic intermediate.},

abstract = {The identification of maximally homologous subsequences among sets of long sequences is an important problem in molecular sequence analysis. The problem is straightforward only if one restricts consideration to contiguous subsequences (segments) containing no internal deletions or insertions. The more general problem has its solution in an extension of sequence metrics (Sellers 1974; Waterman et al., 1976) developed to measure the minimum number of “events” required to convert one sequence into another. These developments in the modern sequence analysis began with the heuristic homology algorithm of Needleman {\&} Wunsch (1970) which first introduced an iterative matrix method of calculation. Numerous other heuristic algorithms have been suggested including those of Fitch (1966) and Dayhoff (1969). More mathemat- ically rigorous algorithms were suggested by Sankoff (1972), Reichert et al. (1973) and Beyer et al. (1979) but these were generally not biologically satisfying or interpretable. Success came with Sellers (1974) development of a true metric measure of the distance between sequences. This metric was later generalized by Waterman et al. (1976) to include deletions/insertions of arbitrary length. This metric represents the minimum number of “mutational events” required to convert one sequence into another. It is of interest to note that Smith et al. (1980) have recently shown that under some conditions the generalized Sellers metric is equivalent to the original homology algorithm of Needleman {\&} Wunsch (1970). In this letter we extend the above ideas to find a pair of segments, one from each of two long sequences, such that there is no other pair of segments with greater similarity (homology). The similarity measure used here allows for arbitrary length deletions and insertions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting the function of an unknown protein is an essential goal in bioinformatics. Sequence similarity-based approaches are widely used for function prediction; however, they are often inadequate in the absence of similar sequences or when the sequence similarity among known protein sequences is statistically weak. This study aimed to develop an accurate prediction method for identifying protein function, irrespective of sequence and structural similarities. RESULTS: A highly accurate prediction method capable of identifying protein function, based solely on protein sequence properties, is described. This method analyses and identifies specific features of the protein sequence that are highly correlated with certain protein functions and determines the combination of protein sequence features that best characterises protein function. Thirty-three features that represent subtle differences in local regions and full regions of the protein sequences were introduced. On the basis of 484 features extracted solely from the protein sequence, models were built to predict the functions of 11 different proteins from a broad range of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. The accuracy of protein function prediction using random forests with feature selection ranged from 94.23{\%} to 100{\%}. The local sequence information was found to have a broad range of applicability in predicting protein function. CONCLUSION: We present an accurate prediction method using a machine-learning approach based solely on protein sequence properties. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose new PNPRD features representing global and/or local differences in sequences, based on positively and/or negatively charged residues, to assist in predicting protein function. In addition, we identified a compact and useful feature subset for predicting the function of various proteins. Our results indicate that sequence-based classifiers can provide good results among a broad range of proteins, that the proposed features are useful in predicting several functions, and that the combination of our and traditional features may support the creation of a discriminative feature set for specific protein functions.},

G10H activity was only detected in cell cultures of species belonging to the Apocynaceae family. The highest levels of G10H activity (240 pkatal/mg protein) were found in cell cultures of Catharanthus roseus. Further increase of G10H activity (335 pkatal/mg protein) could be achieved by transferring the C. roseus cell culture to an induction medium known to enhance alkaloid production. It was shown that G10H activity is correlated to the ability of the cells to accumulate terpenoid indole alkaloids, although it seemed that increased G10H is not the only requirement for increased alkaloid accumulation. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

Here, we report a multivariate-modular approach to metabolic-pathway engineering that succeeded in increasing titers of taxadiene--the first committed Taxol intermediate--approximately 1 gram per liter ({\~{}}15,000-fold) in an engineered Escherichia coli strain. Our approach partitioned the taxadiene metabolic pathway into two modules: a native upstream methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway forming isopentenyl pyrophosphate and a heterologous downstream terpenoid-forming pathway. Systematic multivariate search identified conditions that optimally balance the two pathway modules so as to maximize the taxadiene production with minimal accumulation of indole, which is an inhibitory compound found here. We also engineered the next step in Taxol biosynthesis, a P450-mediated 5$\alpha$-oxidation of taxadiene to taxadien-5$\alpha$-ol. More broadly, the modular pathway engineering approach helped to unlock the potential of the MEP pathway for the engineered production of terpenoid natural products.},

abstract = {Cytochromes P450 represent a numerous family of heme-containing enzymes belonging to the group of monooxygenases. In prokaryotes, cytochromes P450 usually perform a plastic function, whereas in eukaryotes their functions are very diverse. Mammalian cytochromes P450 are components of membranes and are involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of many physiologically active substances; moreover, these cytochromes are unique in their ability to catalyze biotransformation of xenobiotics, i.e. metabolize substances of foreign origin (drugs, toxins, environmental pollutants). The latter promotes elimination of xenobiotics, but sometimes intermediates of their metabolism are even more toxic and dangerous than the original xenobiotics per se. Some catalytic features of cytochromes P450 still need unambiguous explanation, i.e. broad substrate specificity, diversity of catalytic reactions, and unusual kinetics. Under some conditions, cytochromes P450 can produce reactive oxygen species, and this is another problem attracting increasing attention. In this respect, a recent finding in mitochondria of analogs of microsomal cytochromes P450 seems especially intriguing; it was postulated that P450 can be responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction, cell apoptosis, and pathogenesis of some diseases. In this paper the present state of the art concerning these problems is considered.},

@article{Hubbard2001,
abstract = {NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase catalyzes transfer of electrons from NADPH, via two flavin cofactors, to various cytochrome P450s. The crystal structure of the rat reductase complexed with NADP(+) has revealed that nicotinamide access to FAD is blocked by an aromatic residue (Trp-677), which stacks against the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin. To investigate the nature of interactions between the nicotinamide, FAD, and Trp-677 during the catalytic cycle, three mutant proteins were studied by crystallography. The first mutant, W677X, has the last two C-terminal residues, Trp-677 and Ser-678, removed; the second mutant, W677G, retains the C-terminal serine residue. The third mutant has the following three catalytic residues substituted: S457A, C630A, and D675N. In the W677X and W677G structures, the nicotinamide moiety of NADP(+) lies against the FAD isoalloxazine ring with a tilt of approximately 30 degrees between the planes of the two rings. These results, together with the S457A/C630A/D675N structure, allow us to propose a mechanism for hydride transfer regulated by changes in hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions between the isoalloxazine ring and either the nicotinamide ring or Trp-677 indole ring. Superimposition of the mutant and wild-type structures shows significant mobility between the two flavin domains of the enzyme. This, together with the high degree of disorder observed in the FMN domain of all three mutant structures, suggests that conformational changes occur during catalysis.},

abstract = {The human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes are the most important enzymes in the body to metabolize many endogenous and exogenous substances including environmental toxins and therapeutic drugs. Any unnecessary interactions between a small molecule and CYP450 isozymes may raise a potential to disarm the integrity of the protection. Accurately predicting the potential interactions between a small molecule and CYP450 isozymes is highly desirable for assessing the metabolic stability and toxicity of the molecule. The National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) has screened a collection of over 17,000 compounds against the five major isozymes of CYP450 (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) in a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) format. In this study, we developed support vector classification (SVC) models for these five isozymes using a set of customized generic atom types. The CYP450 data sets were randomly split into equal-sized training and test sets. The optimized SVC models exhibited high predictive power against the test sets for all five CYP450 isozymes with accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.89, 0.85, and 0.87 for 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, respectively, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The important atom types and features extracted from the five models are consistent with the structural preferences for different CYP450 substrates reported in the literature. We also identified novel features with significant discerning power to separate CYP450 actives from inactives. These models can be useful in prioritizing compounds in a drug discovery pipeline or recognizing the toxic potential of environmental chemicals.},

abstract = {The Catharanthus (or Vinca) alkaloids comprise a group of about 130 terpenoid indole alkaloids. Vinblastine is now marketed for more than 40 years as an anticancer drug and became a true lead compound for drug development. Due to the pharmaceutical importance and the low content in the plant of vinblastine and the related alkaloid vincristine, Catharanthus roseus became one of the best-studied medicinal plants. Consequently it developed as a model system for biotechnological studies on plant secondary metabolism. The aim of this review is to acquaint a broader audience with the recent progress in this research and with its exciting perspectives. The pharmacognostical aspects of the Catharanthus alkaloids cover botanical (including some historical), phytochemical and analytical data. An up-to-date view on the biosynthesis of the alkaloids is given. The pharmacological aspects of these alkaloids and their semi-synthetic derivatives are only discussed briefly. The biotechnological part focuses on alternative production systems for these alkaloids, for example by in vitro culture of C. roseus cells. Subsequently it will be discussed to what extent the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway can be manipulated genetically ("metabolic engineering"), aiming at higher production levels of the alkaloids. Another approach is to produce the alkaloids (or their precursors) in other organisms such as yeast. Despite the availability of only a limited number of biosynthetic genes, the research on C. roseus has already led to a broad scientific spin-off. It is clear that many interesting results can be expected when more genes become available.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Cytochrome P450 proteins, named for the absorption band at 450 nm of their carbon-monoxide-bound form, are one of the largest superfamilies of enzyme proteins. The P450 genes (also called CYP) are found in the genomes of virtually all organisms, but their number has exploded in plants. Their amino-acid sequences are extremely diverse, with levels of identity as low as 16{\%} in some cases, but their structural fold has remained the same throughout evolution. P450s are heme-thiolate proteins; their most conserved structural features are related to heme binding and common catalytic properties, the major feature being a completely conserved cysteine serving as fifth (axial) ligand to the heme iron. Canonical P450s use electrons from NAD(P)H to catalyze activation of molecular oxygen, leading to regiospecific and stereospecific oxidative attack of a plethora of substrates. The reactions carried out by P450s, though often hydroxylation, can be extremely diverse and sometimes surprising. They contribute to vital processes such as carbon source assimilation, biosynthesis of hormones and of structural components of living organisms, and also carcinogenesis and degradation of xenobiotics. In plants, chemical defense seems to be a major reason for P450 diversification. In prokaryotes, P450s are soluble proteins. In eukaryotes, they are usually bound to the endoplasmic reticulum or inner mitochondrial membranes. The electron carrier proteins used for conveying reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H differ with subcellular localization. P450 enzymes catalyze many reactions that are important in drug metabolism or that have practical applications in industry; their economic impact is therefore considerable.},

abstract = {Liver cytochrome P450s (P450s) play critical roles in drug metabolism, toxicology, and metabolic processes. Despite rapid progress in the understanding of these enzymes, a systematic investigation of the full spectrum of functionality of individual P450s, the interrelationship or networks connecting them, and the genetic control of each gene/enzyme is lacking. To this end, we genotyped, expression-profiled, and measured P450 activities of 466 human liver samples and applied a systems biology approach via the integration of genetics, gene expression, and enzyme activity measurements. We found that most P450s were positively correlated among themselves and were highly correlated with known regulators as well as thousands of other genes enriched for pathways relevant to the metabolism of drugs, fatty acids, amino acids, and steroids. Genome-wide association analyses between genetic polymorphisms and P450 expression or enzyme activities revealed sets of SNPs associated with P450 traits, and suggested the existence of both cis-regulation of P450 expression (especially for CYP2D6) and more complex trans-regulation of P450 activity. Several novel SNPs associated with CYP2D6 expression and enzyme activity were validated in an independent human cohort. By constructing a weighted coexpression network and a Bayesian regulatory network, we defined the human liver transcriptional network structure, uncovered subnetworks representative of the P450 regulatory system, and identified novel candidate regulatory genes, namely, EHHADH, SLC10A1, and AKR1D1. The P450 subnetworks were then validated using gene signatures responsive to ligands of known P450 regulators in mouse and rat. This systematic survey provides a comprehensive view of the functionality, genetic control, and interactions of P450s.},

abstract = {The BRENDA enzyme information system (http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/) has developed into an elaborate system of enzyme and enzyme-ligand information obtained from different sources, combined with flexible query systems and evaluation tools. The information is obtained by manual extraction from primary literature, text and data mining, data integration, and prediction algorithms. Approximately 300 million data include enzyme function and molecular data from more than 30,000 organisms. The manually derived core contains 3 million data from 77,000 enzymes annotated from 135,000 literature references. Each entry is connected to the literature reference and the source organism. They are complemented by information on occurrence, enzyme/disease relationships from text mining, sequences and 3D structures from other databases, and predicted enzyme location and genome annotation. Functional and structural data of more than 190,000 enzyme ligands are stored in BRENDA. New features improving the functionality and analysis tools were implemented. The human anatomy atlas CAVEman is linked to the BRENDA Tissue Ontology terms providing a connection between anatomical and functional enzyme data. Word Maps for enzymes obtained from PubMed abstracts highlight application and scientific relevance of enzymes. The EnzymeDetector genome annotation tool and the reaction database BKM-react including reactions from BRENDA, KEGG and MetaCyc were improved. The website was redesigned providing new query options.},

All the major human drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes have been identified and cloned, and the major gene variants that cause inter-individual variability in drug response and are related to adverse drug reactions have been identified. This information now provides the basis for the use of predictive pharmacogenetics to yield drug therapies that are more efficient and safer. Today, we understand which drugs warrant dosing based on pharmacogenetics to improve drug treatment. It is anticipated that, in the future, genotyping could be used to personalize drug treatment for vast numbers of subjects, decreasing the cost of drug treatment and increasing the efficacy of drugs and health in general. I estimate that such personalized P450 gene-based treatment would be relevant for 10-20{\%} of all drug therapy.},

The CYPED currently integrates sequence and structure data of 3911 and 25 proteins, respectively. Proteins are grouped into homologous families and superfamilies according to Nelson's classification. Nonclassified CYP sequences are assigned by similarity. Functionally relevant residues are annotated. The web accessible version contains multisequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and HMM profiles. The CYPED is regularly updated and supplies all data for download. Thus, it provides a valuable data source for phylogenetic analysis, investigation of sequence-function relationships and the design of CYPs with improved biochemical properties.

abstract = {Machine learning methods are widely used in bioinformatics and computational and systems biology. Here, we review the development of machine learning methods for protein structure prediction, one of the most fundamental problems in structural biology and bioinformatics. Protein structure prediction is such a complex problem that it is often decomposed and attacked at four different levels: 1-D prediction of structural features along the primary sequence of amino acids; 2-D prediction of spatial relationships between amino acids; 3-D prediction of the tertiary structure of a protein; and 4-D prediction of the quaternary structure of a multiprotein complex. A diverse set of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods has been applied over the years to tackle these problems and has significantly contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art of protein structure prediction. In this paper, we review the development and application of hidden Markov models, neural networks, support vector machines, Bayesian methods, and clustering methods in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D protein structure predictions.},

This method uses an in vitro cocktail of specific substrates (midazolam, bufuralol, diclofenac, ethoxyresorufin, S-mephenytoin, coumarin, and paclitaxel) and fast gradient liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The assay incubation time is 20 min, which is in the linear range for all of the substrates, and the analysis time is 4 min/sample. Substrate specificity was confirmed by incubating Escherichia coli-expressed enzymes with the cocktail. Potent specific inhibitors of the seven enzymes (ketoconazole, quinidine, sulfaphenazole, tranylcypromine, quercetin, furafylline, and 8-methoxypsoralen) were evaluated in cocktail and individual substrate incubations. Five of these inhibitors were further studied to determine more precise IC(50) values for inhibition of the seven enzymes. The IC(50) values obtained in both cocktail and individual incubations were in good agreement with published values. This cocktail method offers an efficient, robust way to determine the cytochrome P450 inhibition profile of large numbers of compounds. The enhanced throughput of this method greatly facilitates its use to assess CYP inhibition as a drug candidate selection criterion.},

Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 7615-7616), but to date it has not been possible to observe directly the oxidation of organic halides in NADPH-supported P-450 reactions because of the intrinsic instability of haloso compounds. 4-tert-Butyl-2,5-bis[1-hydroxy-1-(trifluoromethyl)- 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl]iodobenzene (RI) and the corresponding bromine analog (RBr) were utilized as model compounds because their oxidized derivatives (iodinane and brominane) are relatively stable. Several model metalloporphyrins efficiently oxidized RI to the iodinane in the presence of iodosylbenzene. Rates of reduction of Mn(V) = O tetraphenylporphin chloride by RI were considerably faster than for several other organic halides. NADPH-fortified rat liver microsomes oxidized RI to the iodinane, identified by its chromatographic retention time and characteristic UV spectrum. Purified P-450 enzymes also catalyzed the oxidation of RI to the iodinane; more selectivity among individual proteins was seen when the reaction was supported by NADPH and NADPH-P-450 reductase than by iodosylbenzene. Free thiol groups in P-450 and NADPH-P-450 reductase could be oxidized by iodosylbenzene, the iodinane or brominane, or by incubation with NADPH and RI or other organic halides. These results provide evidence that P-450 can oxidize organic halogen atoms. Iodo compounds are definitely oxidized, even though the apparent oxidation-reduction potential differences seem unfavorable. The halogen order seen for the reaction is a function of the oxidation potential. Organic bromine compounds are probably also oxidized by P-450, although the rates are much slower. Chloroperoxidase did not oxidize RI to the iodinane but horseradish peroxidase did so at a lower rate; in this case the iodinane is postulated to form via electron abstraction without oxygen transfer.},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are a superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes with enormous potential for synthetic biology applications. Across Nature, their substrate range is vast and exceeds that of other enzymes. The range of different chemical transformations performed by P450s is also substantial, and continues to expand through interrogation of the properties of novel P450s and by protein engineering studies. The ability of P450s to introduce oxygen atoms at specific positions on complex molecules makes these enzymes particularly valuable for applications in synthetic biology. This review focuses on the enzymatic properties and reaction mechanisms of P450 enzymes, and on recent studies that highlight their broad applications in the production of oxychemicals. For selected soluble bacterial P450s (notably the high-activity P450-cytochrome P450 reductase enzyme P450 BM3), variants with a multitude of diverse substrate selectivities have been generated both rationally and by random mutagenesis/directed evolution approaches. This highlights the robustness and malleability of the P450 fold, and the capacity of these biocatalysts to oxidise a wide range of chemical scaffolds. This article reviews recent research on the application of wild-type and engineered P450s in the production of important chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and drug metabolites, steroids and antibiotics. In addition, the properties of unusual members of the P450 superfamily that do not follow the canonical P450 catalytic pathway are described.},

abstract = {A data set of 379 drugs and drug analogs that are metabolized by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9, respectively, was studied. A series of descriptor sets directly calculable from the constitution of these drugs was systematically investigated as to their power into classifying a compound into the CYP isoform that metabolizes it. In a four-step build-up process eventually 303 different descriptor components were investigated for 146 compounds of a training set by various model building methods, such as multinomal logistic regression, decision tree, or support vector machine (SVM). Automatic variable selection algorithms were used in order to decrease the number of descriptors. A comprehensive scheme of cross-validation (CV) experiments was applied to assess the robustness and reliability of the four models developed. In addition, the predictive power of the four models presented in this paper was inspected by predicting an external validation data set with 233 compounds. The best model has a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated predictivity of 89{\%} and gives 83{\%} correct predictions for the external validation data set. For our favored model we showed the strong influence on the predictivity of the way a data set is split into a training and test data set.},

abstract = {Heme-containing monooxygenases are able to catalyze two different classes of oxidation reactions. The first class includes oxygenation reactions (hydroxylation, epoxidation, N- or S-oxide formation, etc.) which are mediated by an electrophilic oxidative species. The second class is represented by the oxidative deformylation of aldhehydes and involves a nucleophilic oxidant as active intermediate. The reductive activation of molecular oxygen by cytochromes P450 generates a nucleophilic iron(III)-peroxo species which produces by protonation an electrophilic high-valent iron-ore {\{}[{\}}formally an iron(V)oxo] responsible for electrophilic oxygen atom transfers. The nucleophilic properties of the iron(III)-peroxo intermediate in cytochrome P450 are due to the porphyrin ring acting as electron reservoir and also to the negative charge accumulated on the proximal cysteine during the initial reduction step of the catalytic cycle. The nature of the high-valent iron-ore species generated in the catalytic cycle of heme-peroxidases will be also discussed. Among the different methods for studying the oxygenation reactions mediated by high-valent metal-ore porphyrin complexes, the recent discovery of the ``oxo-hydroxo tautomerism{\{}''{\}} provides a useful tool to investigate the mechanism of O-atom transfer reactions in aqueous media.},

Currently PPI networks for individuals are not available, but gene expression data is becoming easier to obtain and allows us to represent individuals by a co-integrated gene expression/protein interaction network. Two major problems hamper the application of graph kernels - state-of-the-art methods for whole-graph comparison - to compare PPI networks. First, these methods do not scale to graphs of the size of a PPI network. Second, missing edges in these interaction networks are biologically relevant for detecting discrepancies, yet, these methods do not take this into account. In this article we present graph kernels for biological network comparison that are fast to compute and take into account missing interactions. We evaluate their practical performance on two datasets of co-integrated gene expression/PPI networks.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

The method is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The method exhibits invariance to diagonal rescaling of the gradients by adapting to the geometry of the objective function. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. We demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.},

Understanding biology is necessary to produce useful data sets, which have to be large and diverse. Separating the training and test process is imperative to avoid over-selling method performance, which is also dependent on several hidden parameters. A novel predictor has always to be compared with several existing methods, including simple baseline strategies.

The method is foremost a reactivity model, and as such, it shows a preference for predicting sites that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform. SMARTCyp predicts the site of metabolism directly from the 2D structure of a molecule, without requiring calculation of electronic properties or generation of 3D structures. This is a major advantage, because it makes SMARTCyp very fast. Other advantages are that experimental data are not a prerequisite to create the model, and it can easily be integrated with other methods to create models for other cytochrome P450 isoforms. Benchmarking tests on a database of 394 3A4 substrates show that SMARTCyp successfully identifies at least one metabolic site in the top two ranked positions 76{\%} of the time. SMARTCyp is available for download at http://www.farma.ku.dk/p450.},

The empirical scoring function is derived from an analysis of a nonredundant database of known structures by converting relative frequencies into pseudoenergies using a normalization according to the inverse Bolzmann law. These-so called contact capacity-potentials turn out to be discriminative enough to detect structural folds in the absence of significant sequence similarity and at the same time simple enough to allow for a very fast optimization in an alignment procedure.},

The CPR gene of Candida bombicola was isolated using degenerate PCR and genomic walking. The gene encodes an enzyme of 687 amino acids, which shows homology with known CPRs of other species. The functionality of the gene was proven by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein exhibited NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reducing activity.

abstract = {The first eukaryote genome revealed three yeast cytochromes P450 (CYPs), hence the subsequent realization that some microbial fungal genomes encode these proteins in 1 per cent or more of all genes (greater than 100) has been surprising. They are unique biocatalysts undertaking a wide array of stereo- and regio-specific reactions and so hold promise in many applications. Based on ancestral activities that included 14$\alpha$-demethylation during sterol biosynthesis, it is now seen that CYPs are part of the genes and metabolism of most eukaryotes. In contrast, Archaea and Eubacteria often do not contain CYPs, while those that do are frequently interesting as producers of natural products undertaking their oxidative tailoring. Apart from roles in primary and secondary metabolism, microbial CYPs are actual/potential targets of drugs/agrochemicals and CYP51 in sterol biosynthesis is exhibiting evolution to resistance in the clinic and the field. Other CYP applications include the first industrial biotransformation for corticosteroid production in the 1950s, the diversion into penicillin synthesis in early mutations in fungal strain improvement and bioremediation using bacteria and fungi. The vast untapped resource of orphan CYPs in numerous genomes is being probed and new methods for discovering function and for discovering desired activities are being investigated.},

The reductase has been separated into two components, a flavoprotein with TPNH-diaphorase activity and a brown-colored nonheme iron protein. Steroid 11-$\beta$-hydroxylase activity has been successfully reconstituted from the TPNH-diaphorase, the nonheme iron protein, and a cytochrome P-450 containing particulate fraction derived from sonicated adrenal cortex mitochondria. These studies provide evidence for the function of cytochrome P-450 in this mixed-function oxidase reaction.},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are a diverse collection of enzymes acting on various endogenous and xenobiotic molecules. Most of them catalyse hydroxylation reactions and one group of possible substrates are fatty acids and their related structures. In this minireview, the significance of P450s in microbial fatty acid conversion is described. Bacteria and yeasts possess various P450 systems involved in alkane and fatty acid degradation, and often several enzymes with different activities and specificities are retrieved in one organism. Furthermore, P450s take part in the formation of fatty acid-based secondary metabolites. Finally, there are a substantial number of microbial P450s displaying activity towards fatty acids, but to which no biological role could be assigned despite the often quite intense research.},

abstract = {Insects use hydrocarbons as cuticular waterproofing agents and as contact pheromones. Although their biosynthesis from fatty acyl precursors is well established, the last step of hydrocarbon biosynthesis from long-chain fatty aldehydes has remained mysterious. We show here that insects use a P450 enzyme of the CYP4G family to oxidatively produce hydrocarbons from aldehydes. Oenocyte-directed RNAi knock-down of Drosophila CYP4G1 or NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase results in flies deficient in cuticular hydrocarbons, highly susceptible to desiccation, and with reduced viability upon adult emergence. The heterologously expressed enzyme converts C(18)-trideuterated octadecanal to C(17)-trideuterated heptadecane, showing that the insect enzyme is an oxidative decarbonylase that catalyzes the cleavage of long-chain aldehydes to hydrocarbons with the release of carbon dioxide. This process is unlike cyanobacteria that use a nonheme diiron decarbonylase to make alkanes from aldehydes with the release of formate. The unique and highly conserved insect CYP4G enzymes are a key evolutionary innovation that allowed their colonization of land.},

abstract = {Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is present in more than 90{\%} of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an inherited metabolic disorder of adrenal steroidogenesis. Impaired enzymatic activity leads to the accumulation of metabolic intermediates (progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone), which results in excessive androgen production and varied signs of virilisation. CYP21A2 is an active gene and encodes for the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme, whereas CYP21A1P is an inactive pseudogene that contains a series of deleterious mutations. The major part of disease-causing mutations in CYP21A2 alleles are CYP21A1P-derived sequence transferred to the active gene by macro or microconversion events. Approximately 5{\%} of all disease-causing CYP21A2 alleles harbour rare mutations that do not originate from the pseudogene. A list of all reported CYP21A2 mutations can be found in the CYP21A2 database created by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Committee (http:www.imm.Ki.se/CYPalleles/cyp21.htm). Unfortunately, the last update of this database was in 2006. However, over the last 4 years many other novel CYP21A2 mutations have been reported in PubMed. The aim of this review is to provide a focus on the molecular and genetic aspects of the diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. In addition, an updated list of the last new CYP21A2 mutations is included.},

The ratio of these products was found to be 0.76:1 when exo,exo,exo,exo-2,3,5,6-tetradueteronorbornane was oxidized. Analysis of the mass spectra of the products from the deuterated hydrocarbon showed that 25{\%} of the exo-norborneol contained four deuterium atoms whereas 9{\%} of the endo-norborneol contained three deuterium atoms. These results, which indicate a very large isotope effect ( kH kD = 11.5??1) and a significant amount of epimerization for the hydroxylation of norbornane by cytochrome P-450, suggest an initial hydrogen abstraction to give a carbon radical intermediate. ?? 1978.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {Proteins are involved in almost every action of every organism by interacting with other small molecules including drugs. Computationally predicting the drug-protein interactions is particularly important in speeding up the process of developing novel drugs. To borrow the information from existing drug-protein interactions, we need to define the similarity among proteins and the similarity among drugs. Usually these similarities are defined based on one single data source and many methods have been proposed. However, the availability of many genomic and chemogenomic data sources allows us to integrate these useful data sources to improve the predictions. Thus a great challenge is how to integrate these heterogeneous data sources. Here, we propose a kernel-based method to predict drug-protein interactions by integrating multiple types of data. Specially, we collect drug pharmacological and therapeutic effects, drug chemical structures, and protein genomic information to characterize the drug-target interactions, then integrate them by a kernel function within a support vector machine (SVM)-based predictor. With this data fusion technology, we establish the drug-protein interactions from a collections of data sources. Our new method is validated on four classes of drug target proteins, including enzymes, ion channels (ICs), G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs), and nuclear receptors (NRs). We find that every single data source is predictive and integration of different data sources allows the improvement of accuracy, i.e., data integration can uncover more experimentally observed drug-target interactions upon the same levels of false positive rate than single data source based methods. The functional annotation analysis indicates that our new predictions are worthy of future experimental validation. In conclusion, our new method can efficiently integrate diverse data sources, and will promote the further research in drug discovery.},

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans--the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

abstract = {The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins plays a key role in the process of genomic drug discovery. It is both consuming and costly to determine drug-target interactions by experiments alone. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new in silico prediction approaches capable of identifying these potential drug-target interactions in a timely manner. In this article, we aim at extending current structure-activity relationship (SAR) methodology to fulfill such requirements. In some sense, a drug-target interaction can be regarded as an event or property triggered by many influence factors from drugs and target proteins. Thus, each interaction pair can be represented theoretically by using these factors which are based on the structural and physicochemical properties simultaneously from drugs and proteins. To realize this, drug molecules are encoded with MACCS substructure fingerings representing existence of certain functional groups or fragments; and proteins are encoded with some biochemical and physicochemical properties. Four classes of drug-target interaction networks in humans involving enzymes, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors, are independently used for establishing predictive models with support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM models gave prediction accuracy of 90.31{\%}, 88.91{\%}, 84.68{\%} and 83.74{\%} for four datasets, respectively. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the ability of our proposed method to predict the drug-target interactions, and show a general compatibility between the new scheme and current SAR methodology. They open the way to a host of new investigations on the diversity analysis and prediction of drug-target interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Profile analysis is a method for detecting distantly related proteins by sequence comparison. The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The structural complexity of taxol dictates continued reliance on biological production methods, which may be improved by a detailed understanding of taxol biosynthesis, especially the rate-limiting steps. The biosynthesis of taxol involves the cyclization of the common isoprenoid intermediate geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxa-4(5), 11(2)-diene followed by extensive, largely oxidative, modification of this diterpene olefin. We set out to define the first oxygenation step in taxol biosynthesis. RESULTS: Microsomal enzymes from Taxus stem and cultured cells were used to define the first hydroxylation of taxadiene. We confirmed the structure of the reaction product (taxa-4(20), 11(12)-dien-5alpha-ol) by synthesizing this compound. The responsible biological catalyst was characterized as a cytochrome P450 (heme thiolate protein). In vivo studies confirmed that taxadienol is a biosynthetic intermediate and indicated that the hydroxylation step that produces this product is slow relative to subsequent metabolic transformations. CONCLUSIONS: The structure of the first oxygenated intermediate on the taxol pathway establishes that the hydroxylation reaction proceeds with an unusual double bond migration that limits the mechanistic possibilities for subsequent elaboration of the oxetane moiety of taxol. The reaction is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450, suggesting that the seven remaining oxygenation steps in taxol biosynthesis may involve similar catalysts. Because the first oxygenation step is slow relative to subsequent metabolic transformations, it may be possible to speed taxol biosynthesis by isolating and manipulating the gene for the taxadiene-5-hydroxylase that catalyzes this reaction.},

This review deals with aspects of cytochrome P450s of relevance to human physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology and medicine. Topics reviewed include: pharmacogenetics of CYPs, induction and inhibition of these haem proteins, their role in metabolism of endogenous compounds such as steroids and eicosanoids, the effect of disease on CYP function, CYPs and cancer, and CYPs as targets of antibodies in immune-mediated diseases.

abstract = {The amino acid sequence of a protein affects both its structure and its function. Thus, the ability to modify the sequence, and hence the structure and activity, of individual proteins in a systematic way, opens up many opportunities, both scientifically and (as we focus on here) for exploitation in biocatalysis. Modern methods of synthetic biology, whereby increasingly large sequences of DNA can be synthesised de novo, allow an unprecedented ability to engineer proteins with novel functions. However, the number of possible proteins is far too large to test individually, so we need means for navigating the 'search space' of possible protein sequences efficiently and reliably in order to find desirable activities and other properties. Enzymologists distinguish binding (Kd) and catalytic (kcat) steps. In a similar way, judicious strategies have blended design (for binding, specificity and active site modelling) with the more empirical methods of classical directed evolution (DE) for improving kcat (where natural evolution rarely seeks the highest values), especially with regard to residues distant from the active site and where the functional linkages underpinning enzyme dynamics are both unknown and hard to predict. Epistasis (where the 'best' amino acid at one site depends on that or those at others) is a notable feature of directed evolution. The aim of this review is to highlight some of the approaches that are being developed to allow us to use directed evolution to improve enzyme properties, often dramatically. We note that directed evolution differs in a number of ways from natural evolution, including in particular the available mechanisms and the likely selection pressures. Thus, we stress the opportunities afforded by techniques that enable one to map sequence to (structure and) activity in silico, as an effective means of modelling and exploring protein landscapes. Because known landscapes may be assessed and reasoned about as a whole, simultaneously, this offers opportunities for protein improvement not readily available to natural evolution on rapid timescales. Intelligent landscape navigation, informed by sequence-activity relationships and coupled to the emerging methods of synthetic biology, offers scope for the development of novel biocatalysts that are both highly active and robust.},

Either FMN domain, ferredoxins or cytochrome b5 serve as the electron transport intermediate between the FAD domain and P450. The molecular evolution of both P450-containing systems and of each particular component does not follow phylogeny in general. Gene fusion and horizontal gene transfer events can lead to the appearance of novel redox chains in the same manner that artificial chimeric proteins can be constructed by humans.

abstract = {Statistical molecular design (SMD) is a technique for selecting a representative (diverse) set of substances in combinatorial chemistry and QSAR, as well as other areas depending on optimising chemical structure. Two approaches often used in SMD are space filling (SF) and D-optimal (DO) designs. Space-filling designs provide good coverage of the physicochemical space but are not explicitly based on a model. For small design sizes, they perform similar to D-optimal designs, which maximize the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix. This leads to selection of the most extreme points of the candidate set and gives a minimal set of selected compounds with maximal diversity. However, the inner regions of the experimental domain are not well sampled by DO or small SF designs. We have developed and evaluated an approach to remedy the shortcomings of SF and DO designs in SMD. This new approach divides the candidate set into a number of subsets ("shells" or "layers"), and a D-optimal selection is made from each layer. This makes it possible to select representative sets of molecular structures throughout any property space, e.g., the physicochemical space, with reasonable design sizes. The number of selected molecules is easily controlled by varying (a) the number of layers and (b) the model on which the design is based. We outline here this new approach, the D-optimal onion design (DOOD). It is tested on two molecular data sets with varying size and compared with SF designs and ordinary DO designs. The designs have been evaluated with parameters, such as condition number, determinant, Tanimoto coefficients and Euclidean distances, as well as external evaluation of the resulting projection to latent structures (PLS) model. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent X-ray crystal structures of human cytochrome P450 2B6 and rabbit cytochrome P450 2B4 in complex with amlodipine showed two bound ligand molecules, one in the active site and one in the substrate access channel. Based on the X-ray crystal structures, we investigated the interactions of P450 2B4 and 2B6 with amlodipine using absorbance spectroscopy, and determined the steady-state kinetics of 7-ethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin and 7-benzyloxyresorufin oxidation by some access channel mutants to evaluate the functional role of these residues in substrate turnover. The results of absorbance titrations are consistent with a simple mechanism with two parallel binding events that result in the formation of the enzyme complex with two molecules of amlodipine. Using this model we were able to resolve two separate ligand-binding events, which are characterized by two distinct KD values in each enzyme. The access channel mutants R73K in P450 2B6 and R73K, V216W, L219W, and F220W in P450 2B4 showed a significant decrease in k cat/KM with the both substrates. Overall, the results suggest that P450 2B4 and 2B6 form an enzyme complex with two molecules of amlodipine in solution, and R73, V216, L219 and F220 in P450 2B4 may play an important role in substrate metabolism. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Classification of proteins sequences into functional and structural families based on sequence homology is a central problem in computational biology. Discriminative supervised machine learning approaches provide good performance, but simplicity and computational efficiency of training and prediction are also important concerns. RESULTS: We introduce a class of string kernels, called mismatch kernels, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to the problem of protein classification and remote homology detection. These kernels measure sequence similarity based on shared occurrences of fixed-length patterns in the data, allowing for mutations between patterns. Thus, the kernels provide a biologically well-motivated way to compare protein sequences without relying on family-based generative models such as hidden Markov models. We compute the kernels efficiently using a mismatch tree data structure, allowing us to calculate the contributions of all patterns occurring in the data in one pass while traversing the tree. When used with an SVM, the kernels enable fast prediction on test sequences. We report experiments on two benchmark SCOP datasets, where we show that the mismatch kernel used with an SVM classifier performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods for homology detection, particularly when very few training examples are available. Examination of the highest-weighted patterns learned by the SVM classifier recovers biologically important motifs in protein families and superfamilies.},

abstract = {Abstract Deep learning excels in vision and speech applications where it pushed the state- of-the-art to a new level. However its impact on other fields remains to be shown. The Merck Kaggle challenge on chemical compound activity was won by Hin- ton's group with deep networks. This indicates the high potential of deep learning in drug design and attracted the attention of big pharma. However, the unreal- istically small scale of the Kaggle dataset does not allow to assess the value of deep learning in drug target prediction if applied to in-house data of pharmaceu- tical companies. Even a publicly available drug activity data base like ChEMBL is magnitudes larger than the Kaggle dataset. ChEMBL has 13M compound de- scriptors, 1.3Mcompounds, and 5 k drug targets, compared to the Kaggle dataset with 11 k descriptors, 164 k compounds, and 15 drug targets. On the ChEMBL database, we compared the performance of deep learning to seven target prediction methods, including two commercial predictors, three pre- dictors deployed by pharma, and machine learning methods that we could scale to this dataset. Deep learning outperformed all other methods with respect to the area under ROC curve and was significantly better than all commercial products. Deep learning surpassed the threshold to make virtual compound screening possible and has the potential to become a standard tool in industrial drug design.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450cam with its substrate, camphor, bound has been refined to R = 0.19 at a normal resolution of 1.63 ??. While the 1.63 ?? model confirms our initial analysis based on the 2.6 ?? model, the higher resolution structure has revealed important new details. These include a more precise assignment of sequence to secondary structure, the identification of three cis-proline residues, and a more detailed picture of substrate-protein interactions. In addition, 204 ordered solvent molecules have been found, one of which appears to be a cation. The cation stabilizes an unfavorable polypeptide conformation involved in forming part of the active site pocket, suggesting that the cation may be the metal ion binding site associated with the well-known ability of metal ions to enhance formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Another unusual polypeptide conformation forms the proposed oxygen-binding pocket. A localized distortion and widening of the distal helix provides a pocket for molecular oxygen. An intricate system of side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds aids in stabilizing the required local disruption in helical geometry. Sequence homologies strongly suggest a common oxygen-binding pocket in all P450 species. Further sequence comparisons between P450 species indicate common three-dimensional structures with changes focused in a region of the molecule postulated to be associated with the control of substrate specificity. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {The geraniol-derived (seco)iridoid skeleton is a precursor for a large group of bioactive compounds with diverse therapeutic applications, including the widely used anticancer molecule vinblastine. Despite of this economic prospect, the pathway leading to iridoid biosynthesis from geraniol is still unclear. The first geraniol hydroxylation step has been reported to be catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP76B6 from Catharanthus roseus and CYP76C1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present study, an extended functional analysis of CYP76 family members was carried-out to identify the most effective enzyme to be used for pathway reconstruction. This disproved CYP76C1 activity and led to the characterization of CYP76C4 from A. thaliana as a geraniol 9- or 8-hydroxylase. CYP76B6 emerged as a highly specialized multifunctional enzyme catalyzing two sequential oxidation steps leading to the formation of 8-oxogeraniol from geraniol. This dual function was confirmed in planta using a leaf-disc assay. The first step, geraniol hydroxylation, was very efficient and fast enough to outcompete geraniol conjugation in plant tissues. When the enzyme was expressed in leaf tissues, 8-oxogeraniol was converted into further oxidized and/or reduced compounds in the absence of the next enzyme of the iridoid pathway. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Metabolic Engineering Society.},

abstract = {The interaction of non-covalently bound monomeric protein subunits forms oligomers. The oligomeric proteins are superior to the monomers within the scope of functional evolution of biomacromolecules. Such complexes are involved in various biological processes, and play an important role. It is highly desirable to predict oligomer types automatically from their sequence. Here, based on the concept of pseudo amino acid composition, an improved feature extraction method of weighted auto-correlation function of amino acid residue index and Naive Bayes multi-feature fusion algorithm is proposed and applied to predict protein homo-oligomer types. We used the support vector machine (SVM) as base classifiers, in order to obtain better results. For example, the total accuracies of A, B, C, D and E sets based on this improved feature extraction method are 77.63, 77.16, 76.46, 76.70 and 75.06{\%} respectively in the jackknife test, which are 6.39, 5.92, 5.22, 5.46 and 3.82{\%} higher than that of G set based on conventional amino acid composition method with the same SVM. Comparing with Chou's feature extraction method of incorporating quasi-sequence-order effect, our method can increase the total accuracy at a level of 3.51 to 1.01{\%}. The total accuracy improves from 79.66 to 80.83{\%} by using the Naive Bayes Feature Fusion algorithm. These results show: 1) The improved feature extraction method is effective and feasible, and the feature vectors based on this method may contain more protein quaternary structure information and appear to capture essential information about the composition and hydrophobicity of residues in the surface patches that buried in the interfaces of associated subunits; 2) Naive Bayes Feature Fusion algorithm and SVM can be referred as a powerful computational tool for predicting protein homo-oligomer types.},

Thus a 3D structure can be translated into a 1D sequence of PBs.

We recently created a library of at least 2,300 new active chimeras of the biotechnologically important cytochrome P450 enzymes. Here we show that a chimera's thermostability can be predicted from the additive contributions of its sequence fragments. Based on these predictions, we constructed a family of 44 novel thermostable P450s with half-lives of inactivation at 57 degrees C up to 108 times that of the most stable parent. Although they differ by as many as 99 amino acids from any known P450, the stable sequences are catalytically active. Among the novel functions they exhibit is the ability to produce drug metabolites. This chimeric P450 family provides a unique ensemble for biotechnological applications and for studying sequence-stability-function relationships.},

In regards to the proteochemometric modeling we represented the chemical compounds by molecular signature descriptors and the CYP-isoforms by alignment-independent description of composition and transition of amino acid properties of their protein primary sequences. The entire training dataset contained 63 391 interactions and the best PCM model was obtained using signature descriptors of height 1, 2 and 3 and inducing the model with a support vector machine. The model showed excellent predictive ability with internal AUC = 0.923 and an external AUC = 0.940, as evaluated on a large external dataset. The advantage of PCM models is their extensibility making it possible to extend our model for new CYP isoforms and polymorphic CYP forms. A key benefit of PCM is that all proteins are confined in one single model, which makes it generally more stable and predictive as compared with single target models. The inclusion of the model in Bioclipse Decision Support makes it possible to make virtual instantaneous predictions (∼100 ms per prediction) while interactively drawing or modifying chemical structures in the Bioclipse chemical structure editor.},

abstract = {Kernel methods provide a powerful and unified framework for pattern discovery, motivating algorithms that can act on general types of data (e.g. strings, vectors or text) and look for general types of relations (e.g. rankings, classifications, regressions, clusters). The application areas range from neural networks and pattern recognition to machine learning and data mining. This book, developed from lectures and tutorials, fulfils two major roles: firstly it provides practitioners with a large toolkit of algorithms, kernels and solutions ready to use for standard pattern discovery problems in fields such as bioinformatics, text analysis, image analysis. Secondly it provides an easy introduction for students and researchers to the growing field of kernel-based pattern analysis, demonstrating with examples how to handcraft an algorithm or a kernel for a new specific application, and covering all the necessary conceptual and mathematical tools to do so.},

@article{McCord1971,
abstract = {The distribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase has been examined in various micro-organisms. Strict anaerobes exhibited no superoxide dismutase and, generally, no catalase activity. All aerobic organisms containing cytochrome systems were found to contain both superoxide dismutase and catalase. Aerotolerant anaerobes, which survive exposure to air and metabolize oxygen to a limited extent but do not contain cytochrome systems, were found to be devoid of catalase activity but did exhibit superoxide dismutase activity. This distribution is consistent with the proposal that the prime physiological function of superoxide dismutase is protection of oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the potentially detrimental effects of the superoxide free radical, a biologically produced intermediate resulting from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen.},

abstract = {Deep Learning's recent successes have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks, which exploit fundamental statistical properties of images, sounds and video data: the local stationarity and multi-scale compositional structure, that allows express-ing long range interactions in terms of shorter, localized interactions. However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities. In this paper we consider the general question of how to construct deep architec-tures with small learning complexity on general non-Euclidean domains, which are typically unknown and need to be estimated from the data. In particular, we develop an extension of Spectral Networks which incorporates a Graph Estima-tion procedure, that we test on large-scale classification problems, matching or improving over Dropout Networks with far less parameters to estimate.},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A2 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of 2-amino-3,5-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) and other heterocyclic arylamines and their bioactivation to mutagens. Random mutant libraries of human P450 1A2, in which mutations were made throughout the entire open reading frame, were screened with Escherichia coli DJ3109pNM12, a strain designed to bioactivate MeIQ and detect mutagenicity of the products. Mutant clones with enhanced activity were confirmed using quantitative measurement of MeIQ N-hydroxylation. Three consecutive rounds of random mutagenesis and screening were performed and yielded a highly improved P450 1A2 mutant, SF513 (E225N/Q258H/G437D), with {\textgreater}10-fold increased MeIQ activation based on the E. coli genotoxicity assay and 12-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) in steady-state N-hydroxylation assays done with isolated membrane fractions. SF513 displayed selectively enhanced activity for MeIQ compared to other heterocyclic arylamines. The enhanced catalytic activity was not attributed to changes in any of several individual steps examined, including substrate binding, total NADPH oxidation, or H(2)O(2) formation. Homology modeling based on an X-ray structure of rabbit P450 2C5 suggested that the E225N and Q258H mutations are located in the F-helix and G-helix, respectively, and that the G437D mutation is in the "meander" region, apparently rather distant from the substrate. In summary, the approach generated a mutant enzyme with selectively elevated activity for a single substrate, even to the extent of a difference of a single methyl group, and several mutations had interacting roles in the development of the selected mutant protein.},

abstract = {The cytochrome P450 (P450) superfamily plays an important role in the metabolism of drug compounds, and it is therefore highly desirable to have models that can predict whether a compound interacts with a specific isoform of the P450s. In this work, we provide in silico models for classification of CYP1A2 inhibitors and noninhibitors. Training and test sets consisted of approximately 400 and 7000 compounds, respectively. Various machine learning techniques, such as binary quantitative structure activity relationship, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, kappa nearest neighbor (kNN), and decision tree methods were used to develop in silico models, based on Volsurf and Molecular Operating Environment descriptors. The best models were obtained using the SVM, random forest, and kNN methods in combination with the BestFirst variable selection method, resulting in models with 73 to 76{\%} of accuracy on the test set prediction (Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.51 and 0.52). Finally, a decision tree model based on Lipinski's Rule-of-Five descriptors was also developed. This model predicts 67{\%} of the compounds correctly and gives a simple and interesting insight into the issue of classification. All of the models developed in this work are fast and precise enough to be applicable for virtual screening of CYP1A2 inhibitors or noninhibitors or can be used as simple filters in the drug discovery process.},

Although these types of search algorithms are extraordinarily efficient compared with purely random methods, they do not explicitly represent or interrogate the genotype-phenotype relationship and are essentially blind in nature. Recently, however, researchers have begun to apply multivariate statistical techniques to model protein sequence-function relationships and guide the evolutionary process by rapidly identifying beneficial diversity for recombination. In conjunction with state-of-the-art library generation methods, the statistical approach to sequence optimization is now being used routinely to create enzymes efficiently for industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The crystal structure of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics target APC35832, a 14.7-kDa cytosolic protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been determined at 1.3 A resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method from a mercury soaked crystal. The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {The P450 type cytochromes are responsible for the metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Although P450-catalyzed reactions are generally thought to lead to detoxication of xenobiotics, the reactions can also produce reactive intermediates that can react with cellular macromolecules leading to toxicity or that can react with the P450s that form them leading to irreversible (i.e., mechanism-based) inactivation. This perspective describes the fundamentals of mechanism-based inactivation as it pertains to P450 enzymes. The experimental approaches used to characterize mechanism-based inactivators are discussed, and the criteria required for a compound to be classified as a mechanism-based inactivator are outlined. The kinetic scheme for mechanism-based inactivation and the calculation of the relevant kinetic constants that describe a particular inactivation event are presented. The structural aspects and important functional groups of several classes of molecules that have been found to impart mechanism-based inactivation upon metabolism by P450s such as acetylenes, thiol-containing compounds that include isothiocyanates, thiazolidinediones, and thiophenes, arylamines, quinones, furanocoumarins, and cyclic tertiary amines are described. Emphasis throughout this perspective is placed on more recent findings with human P450s where the site of modification, whether it be the apoprotein or the heme moiety, and, at least in part, the identity of the reactive intermediate responsible for the loss in P450 activity are known or inferred. Recent advances in trapping procedures as well as new methods for identification of reactive intermediates are presented. A variety of clinically important drugs that act as mechanism-based inactivators of P450s are discussed. The irreversible inactivation of human P450s by these drugs has the potential for causing serious drug?drug interactions that may have severe toxicological effects. The clinical significance of inactivating human P450s for improving drug efficacy as well as drug safety is discussed along with the potential for exploiting mechanism-based inactivators of P450s for therapeutic benefits.},

In an attempt to overcome these issues, the conversion of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells similar to ESCs, commonly termed nuclear reprogramming, has been a top objective of contemporary biology. More than 40 years ago, King, Briggs, and Gurdon pioneered somatic cell nuclear reprogramming in frogs, and in 1981 Evans successfully isolated mouse ESCs. In 1997 Wilmut and collaborators produced the first cloned mammal using nuclear transfer, and then Thomson obtained human ESCs from in vitro fertilized blastocysts in 1998. Over the last 2 decades we have also seen remarkable findings regarding how ESC behavior is controlled, the importance of which should not be underestimated. This knowledge allowed the laboratory of Shinya Yamanaka to overcome brilliantly conceptual and technical barriers in 2006 and generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse fibroblasts by overexpressing defined combinations of ESC-enriched transcription factors. Here, we discuss some important implications of human iPSCs for biology and medicine and also point to possible future directions.},
